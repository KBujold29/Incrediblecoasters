We're here at Elitch Gardens to ride Mind Eraser. Your Typical SLC. After waiting for a disgustingly long time (WARNING. This ride is actually popular for some reason. Expect a long line for this ride), you climb into the seat and pull down the shoulder harness. Then you dispatch. Up the lift you go. Once you reach the top, it's all downhill from there. You curve and away and down you go! However, from here on out, this ride...rattles. It doesn't really hurt, but it's most definetly rough. Once you reach the bottom of the first drop, it's all fast. Then you soar up in the sea serpent roll, It's fairly painful going through it, your head is banging around hitting back and forth against the OTSRs. OUCH!!! DAMN IT!!! Then after flipping upsidedown a second time, you head back down and head straight for the overbanked turn. While this turn isn't painful per se, it just sort of rattles. It feels like the train is going to fall apart. Then you head for the sidewinder. You get a nice SMACK coming out of it. And it hurts. It hurts Though to be fair, I can point out that it's worse on other SLCs. Then you turn around, getting a decent view of the park, though there is the Denver skyline in the background. But yeah, this view sucks. After that, you straight for two inline twists. The Inline Twists are AWFUL!!!!! The train is rattling the whole time, except now, you're rattling and shaking as you're being flipped. It's almost like those carnival foot vibrators, only on your entire body. If it bitchslapped you while it vibrated. F*CK!!! THIS IS AWFUL!!! Then there's not that much. You go through a small hill, around a turn, and down another slight hill, only to glide into the brake run. Mind Eraser is a sh*tty SLC. While it's not quite as bad as some of the really bad SLCs, it does have some pain to this ride and some bad headbanging. But honestly, what really makes this ride bad and rough, is that the ride has far more back and forth banging. It honestly feels like this ride is made with chewing gum and rubber bands. I would not recommend you ride Mind Eraser unless you're an SLC Virgin or a credit whore with a lot of time to kill.
