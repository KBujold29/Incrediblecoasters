I may not be a big fan of Cars as its by far my least favorite Pixar Movie, but this is a great area.

Yeah. They just have Mater driving all around Carsland. I hope he's getting a good salary for all the advertising he's doing for the park.

<center>
In the bad news though, Indiana Jones was HORRIBLE tonight. Many of the effects weren't working and the sound was spotty to the point where it seemed more like the audio on X2. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="matterhorn44.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

</center>
<center>
I honestly prefered the old cars to these ones. But hey. Its still Matterhorn, which is still a fun ride.
</center>
