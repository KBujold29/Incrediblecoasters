</center>
<center>
Time for yet another park, and today's park, Farup Sommerland, was good. Well, they all were, but this one was just particuarlly great.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And we have lots of ERT today. First up, the park's mini suspended coaster, Orkanen.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Test Seat.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While this may not look like anything special, it's just a really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I can plant my ass on this ride all day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That overbanked turn actually has some decent whip right there. It's a really nice experience.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For some reason, I just LOVE the setting on this coaster. Especially the 2nd half where it's just a bunch of low to the ground turns in the grass and flowers. Something about that just really appeals to me. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving on with ERT, we now go to the park's wooden coaster, Falken.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign338.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Somebody needs to shine some headlights on those deer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Falken is another one of those super rare S&S Wooden Coasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On the bright side, this ride has some REALLY good airtime. Just, wow. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But on the downside, it is REALLY rough around the turns. Ouch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ass goes out of seat, ass falls back into seat.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="falken5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Even so, it's a great ride that you should definetly check out while visiting Farup Sommerland. I just wish it went in a straight line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lynet.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And finally, we close ERT with a ride on Lynet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lynet2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lynet is one of those Gerstlauter launched coasters that quite frankly, are extremely underrated and totally kick ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lynet3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's got a good launch, great airtime, fun laterals...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lynet4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, twisty inversions with lots of hangtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lynet5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WEE!!! TWISTY!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="foodline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and they opened up the cafe for us to buy breakfast during ERT. I can wait till lunch though.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFARUP.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bow down before AJ!! King of the Playground!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFARUP2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder if I should...Nah. I've got a better place for that. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFARUP3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on dude. Nobody wants to see that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flagermusen.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. The park is open, so let's get the rest of the credits.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flagermusen2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was good spinning mouse. I mean, this thing SPUN!!!! Thumbs up from Incrediblecoasters. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pindsvinet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cha-Ching!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mineexpressen.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Final credit needed at the park. It was a fun Vekoma Roller Skater.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minigolf3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Farup Sommerland is kind of like a big summer camp with roller coasters. As such, it has all sorts of cool random things. Mini Golf doesn't begin to cover it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horse3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Much to David's dismay, you can go horseback riding.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="targetshooting.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You can also practice your shooting here by shooting BB Guns to practice your aim (I am stunned that this hasn't popped up in all of the Texas Theme Parks).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="targetshooting2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And as luck would have it, I am the worst shooter on the planet. So even if I do snap and go crazy for some reason, you'll still be safe.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign339.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Something I've noticed about Danish Parks. They are extremely dog friendly. They even offer those plastic bags used to pick up your dog's poop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dogwaterfountain.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They even have dog water fountains for when Rover gets thirsty, which is great and all, but I'm kind of annoyed at the fact that they have water fountains for dogs throughout the park, but not a single water fountain for humans. Do I have to drink from the sink to get water over here (I just bought a Coke since I overbudgeted in Danish and Swedish Kroners and still have plenty of both currencies left over)?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pillowFARUP.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh look. Another one of those bouncy pillows. Are we gonna stop and jump on it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pillowFARUP2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Does a bear sh*t in the woods?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="triangleFARUP.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They also have one of those crazy triangles to climb.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="triangleFARUP2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't bother with the triangle slides. They suck. You're better off just jumping off.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch36.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Once again, Farup Sommerland has provided a fantastic lunch for us. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shirt7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As a bonus present, the park decided to give us these special T-Shirts as a present. Thank you guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFARUP4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I didn't try this bizzare contraption, but it did look fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFARUP5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Excuse me, but where can I find a place to have my picnic?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pindsvinet2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I got all the credits this morning, but everyone else in the group still needed the kiddy credit, so here we are.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pindsvinet3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Out of peer pressure, I ended up re-riding a kiddy coaster where not only did I already had the credit, but it was bad even by kiddy coaster standards.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="orkanen7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We just had to have ourselves a mini marathon on Orkanen. It's just that enjoyable and re-ridable. Hell, we had to leave Neil here cause he simply refused to get off the ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="farupboats.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
God these boats are such a pain in the ass to drive.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="teacupsFARUP.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone else wanna ride the teacups?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've heard a lot of good things about the obstacle course at Farup Sommerland. So of course, we have to check it out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First things first, you gotta go through this maze, which is actually a challenge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You could rock climb across, or just walk. There's no incentive for this. Perhaps some water should be placed right here. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You could get down the hard way...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Or you can go down the fun way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't feel bad about hitting your head Neil. It may hurt, but it doesn't hurt nearly as bad as...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Harrison losing his $900 sunglasses to the water. Why the hell were you wearing $900 sunglasses on a trip like this?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I should probably warn you that that water is full of leeches (not fear-mongering, It actually is).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP8.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't fall off the zipline. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="obstaclecourseFARUP9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This obstacle course is awesome.
</center>

</center>
<center>
One last ride on Lynet before heading out (there's GREAT ejector air right there).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaport.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The trip moves on and it's time for us to leave Denmark and move onto the next portion of the trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateboat.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly, we will not be crossing the Kattegat in the pirate ship.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
We were early and had 45 minutes until we boarded the ferry. So being the traveler I am, I ventured off into the small seaside town of Fredrikshavn.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I must admit, Fredrikshavn looks like a nice litle town.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know some of my non-roller coaster friends were annoyed that I went all the way to Scandinavia and the only cities I really explored were Copenhagen and Helsinki. Well sorry. I love travelling, seeing local stuff, and I squeeze it in whenever I can. Like right now. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mannequin.JPG" width="480" height="640" />

<center>
Why is a victim of Guantanamo Bay in your shop?

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Pff. I'm not slowing down for the freaking sidewalk.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Be sure to look for this man in the 2018 World Cup representing the United States. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn5.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I love all the beautiful little touches in these small little European towns.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Once again, the statues have predicted the near future.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign340.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, that was fun exploring Frederikshavn. Time to get on the ferry.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frederikshavn6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goodbye Denmark. You're an amazing country and I'm looking foreword to coming back ASAP.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferry3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Drive the bus right onto the ferry.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferry4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After chatting for a bit outside, we moved inside for dinner and just stayed here for the entire ferry.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not a fan of most of the food here, but the potatoes here were fantastic.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dessert4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, I approve of the Chocolate Moose for dessert.
</center>

Ross and Joe share an intamate moment.

<center>
  <img src="goteborg.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We arrived in Goteborg around midnight and all the Swedes were out in the street celebrating the Summer Solstice. I so would've joined in if I didn't have to wake up at 4:30 am.
