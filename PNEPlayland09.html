Ok, so I was out in Vancouver for week. Though I was in film school for most of that week, I still got to do a couple of touristy stuff, but most of all, I got to go to PNE Playland!!! To show how Canadian we are, we ended up flying Air Canada.
</center>

<center>
I'm not that exited about going to Canada. I'm just super happy I got a gummy bear in a pack of fruit snacks!!!!
</center>

We made it all the way to Canada, only to be locked out of our room.

</center>
<center>
As you can see in this picture, most of the buildings in Vancouver look the same.
</center>

<center>
This is the Vancouver Steam Clock. Steam comes out of it. Fascinating. Huh. =)

<center>
While this suspension bridge had a cool view, it wasn't all that great as it didn't really sway that much and was all jammed up with tourists taking their picture on the bridge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign264.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is the sign when I first saw it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign265.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And this is what it looked like when I came back 15 minutes later. What!!? NO!!! HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF CAUSING THE GRAFFITI!!!
</center>

<p>

<center>
Doing the ziplines at Gorse Mtn was pretty fun.
</center>

<p>

<center>
WEE!!!!!!!
</center>

Vancouver from Gourse Mountain.

<center>
And now for the theme park portion of this update, here we are at PNE Playland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pneplayland2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, this is the last picture in the update taken with my still camera. From this point on, all the pictures in this update came from my footage. (Damn my still camera battery.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pneplayland3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyways, here we are at PNE Playland. My 3rd Park in Canada.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pneplayland4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh Damn It! I was hoping to ride the Enterprise. Oh well. I didn't come here to ride the Enterprise.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is the real reason I came to PNE Playland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All Right. Credit #162. Looks like a fun wooden coaster. Let's see how it is. (Oh, Those trains are AWSOME!!!)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While going up the lifthill, it seems like a pretty normal wooden coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All I have to say about this ride is "OH MY FU*KING GOD!!!!!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First off, it has these really awsome turns. They arn't quite as good as Mavericks, but they're still strong enough to make my video camera glitch!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And the airtime. It is SO STRONG!!!!! Every hill felt like Jackrabbit's Double Down!!! It was that fu*king insane!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The airtime was such a huge shock for Allie!! (Before this, the strongest airtime she's dealt with were the bunny hops on CA Screamin without the trims.) So from this point on out, all the captions are going to be quotes from Allie as she experiences TRUE EJECTOR AIR for the first time ever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"OH MY GOD!!!!! DID YOU SEE THAT!!!!!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I THINK I BROKE MY ARM!!!!! I HIT IT REALLY HARD ON THE SEAT ON THAT LAST BUNNY HOP!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"CELESTE IS GOING TO FLY OUT OF HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hauntedmansionPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Screw that!!! It's all about Coaster here!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beachpartyblastPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Read the caption above.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chairswingsPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok Celeste. We'll go on the chairswings for you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I feel like I've seen this coaster before.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh now I know where I've seen this before. This is the coaster from Final Destination 3!!!! So you're the coaster that gave the whole world POVaphobia.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's Bullsh*t the Ride!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh oh. I'm having fun on this ride. Fun is related to danger. Which means we must be in danger here!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Our death clocks are all ticking. Why? Because Final Destination 3 says so!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh oh. This rollercoaster goes upsidedown. Everyone knows that going upsidedown is dangerous. We must be dying here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"OH SH*T!!!!! THERE'S A VIDEO CAMERA ON THIS ROLLERCOASTER!!!! EVERYBODY GET AWAY FROM THE RIDE!!! IT'S GOING TO CRASH!!!! WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But wait, we're all fine. You know why? Because we all live by the laws of physics and not the watery bullsh*t known as Final Destination 3.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Laws of Physics 1. Final Destination 3 Believing Retards 0.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logflume.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why does this Log Flume feel like it came straight out of RCT1?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hellevator.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. They also have a Space Shot here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hellevator2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey California Adventure! IOA got Dr Doom right and PNE Playland got Hellevator right! Why can't that big makeover of yours include removing the screamshields from Maliboomer?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheelPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, I'm not a Ferris Wheel Enthusiast. I just rode this to get some shots of PNE Playland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateshipPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Andrew. Does this please you?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainbowbobsPNE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Heres another cool flat ride I saw from the Ferris Wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewPNE10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bullsh*t the Ride from the Ferris Wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revelation.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right! My first Skyscraper!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign76.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'd probably be dead if I didn't.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revelation2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here you can see Revelation from the ferris wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revelation3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To my dissapointment, it wasn't all that intense.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revelation4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news is that it was fast. REALLY FAST!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revelation5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"FLIP DAMMIT!!! FLIP!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, that's enough of the rest of PNE Playland. Let's get back to Coaster and its awsomeness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Words can not describe how much I love this coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster13.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the first drop is fun and all...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's the ejector air that makes the ride so great.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster15.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry Phoinex. I know you're a kickass woodie and all and I love you alot. And I mean ALOT!!! But you're just not my #1 Wooden Coaster anymore. That just has to go to Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster16.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I'd like a Big Mac Combo please and for dessert, an extra large helping of EJECTOR AIR please!!!!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coaster17.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To end this update, we'll show Coaster and it's badass ejector air!!! Now go to Vancouver and ride this Awesome Awesome Coaster!!!
