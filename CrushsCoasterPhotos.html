We're here at Disneyland Paris, where we'll be reviewing Crush's Coaster. The park's spinning coaster. This is for the most part, a pretty average spinning coaster, but Disney customized it with some really cool theming as well as a bonus little dark ride section. All right. Let's get riding. We get in the shell themed cars, pull down the lap bar, and off we go. We head around a turn and begin climbing the lifthill, directly in the dark. We then head out of the dark and then dip out into the outside world. Enjoy this moment outside and then we go back into the dark. We then head around a turn and see all these really cool lights, as we roam around the dark ride section. We then hear Crush talking to us, though he's speaking in French, so we can't understand him. But hey, we are in France, so don't complain you jackass. We then pass by Bruce, who cites the Shark Pledge to us. "People are friends. Not food." Thank you, glad to know I won't be killed. We then climb the lifthill, we head around a turn, through some straight track. We then head down a curved drop to the bottom. And though we can't see what's going on, I know it's the standard Maurer Sohne spinner layout. So I'm just copying and pasting from here on out. We don't get much spinning action here, but its a fun drop and delivers some speed. You then head up a curved hill, it doesn't cause us to spin much, but it's still enjoyable. We then head into some trims before dropping down and getting more action. We then head down another drop, through one of those vertical horseshoe elements, and then around another upward curve into more brakes. Hey, at least we get some spinning action in that. We then head around another drop, around another curve through some more S shaped track that should spin us or give us some laterals, but doesn't. Go through more brakes, down another small drop, through more curves and into a downward helix. Hey, more spinning action. We then head up a small hill, around more curves, and into the brake run. Hey, it may be standard, but it's still fun. And hey. I love the theme to the East Pacific Current. Just be warned. This ride has no fast pass, and no single rider line. So be warned. You will be waiting a good amount of time in line.
