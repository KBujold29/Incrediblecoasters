Ok, for Spring Break, we decided to go to Knotts Berry Farm. But we also decided to go to the Disneyland Resort to take advantage of the "Go on your Birthday, Get in Free. And if you have a season pass, Have a $60.00 gift card to the Disney Store" Deal. And as you can clearly see, it was RIDICOUSLY CROWDED!!!!!!

And we left early as it was just too crowded. I mean, I've seen it crowded plenty of times. I've been on Summer Saturdays and at Christmas Time, so I've seen it crowded, but today was just F**KING RIDICOULOUS!!!!!
