Six Flags Great Adventure is one of the biggest amusement parks in the world with one of the largest roller coaster collections in the world. Yeah, when most people think of mega roller coaster parks, they'll usually think of parks like <a href="OfficialCedarPointPage.html">Cedar Point</a> and <a href="OfficialSixFlagsMagicMountainPage.html">Six Flags Magic Mountain</a>, and yes. Both of those are major roller coaster parks, but Six Flags Great Adventure is easily amongst them as far as major roller coasters go. It's got a really big collection. And not only is it big, but it features some really good roller coasters including the best roller coaster we have ever ridden. El Toro. No joke. El Toro is the best roller coaster ever. So yeah. It's an amazing park if you're a die-hard roller coaster enthusiast. You care about nothing but roller coasters. This park will make you wet. But even outside all the big and crazy roller coasters, Six Flags Great Adventure is still a decent park. It's got a nice variety of other stuff including some unique to America stuff such as one of the only Vekoma Mad Houses in the United States. And though a lot of enthusiasts tend to forget about it, there's actually a safari part of the park and though I didn't check it out when I was there, and perhaps best of all. They contain the best operations out of any Six Flags park. Seriously, I can't think of ANY other Six Flags Park that frequently runs 3 trains on their major coasters. And that's during the non-busy times. And the employees their bust their ass to keep the lines moving. And as a former ride operator and a frequent vistor of amusement parks, I REALLY appreciate good operations. So keep up the great work Six Flags Great Adventure.

Here are the reviews of all the Flat Rides at Six Flags Great Adventure. Well, they used to have the tallest drop tower in the world. Zumanjaro, which was basically Lex Luthor, only slightly taller, making it the tallest drop tower in the world. And yeah. Zumanjaro was pretty similar. Except...somehow, not as thrilling. I'm not sure why. Wish I got more than one ride on it. Unfortunately, Zumanjaro was demolished along with Kingda Ka with no announcement or warning. Just spontaneously dead as part of the great Coaster Genocide that Cedar Flags did when they did their merger, which......I can not express just how pissed I am about all of that. But back to Six Flags Great Adventure and their flat ride collection. Moving on from Zumanjaro, let's go onto their unique flat ride that still exists. Houdini's Great Escape. This is a Vekoma Mad House. Now if you live in Europe or have visited a lot of parks in Europe, you'll quickly find out that these rides are EVERYWHERE in the European Region. However, there are only 2 in the United States, one of which is here at Six Flags Great Adventure. Now if you constantly ride these rides, they definetly grow old. However, for someone riding a Mad House for the first time, these rides are amazing. I know I LOVED them until I rode them constantly when I was in Europe. The only other flat ride they have that's unique are the ones that are now rare due to all the similar versions dying off. Such as their Top Spin, Twister. Now this is nothing special. It's just an ordinary Top Spin with a mediocre program. However, Top Spins have been getting demolished at such a fast rate that they're now offically a rare ride and something special for the few parks that have not torn out their Top Spins. Hopefully this one stays, even if the program is lame. I was talking about their Parachute Tower in the past, except.....now they too...have demolished their parachute tower since.....Six Flags Great Adventure has been demolishing rides like crazy. Cedar Flags have NOT been treating this park well. They also have a Starflyer, some bumper cars, a pirate ship, a scrambler, some teacups, a round up, and a ferris wheel.

As long as you're not from Europe and ride them all the time, then these rides are pretty funky.

I never rode any of the water rides at Six Flags Great Adventure. However, neither their log flume nor their river rapids ride appeared to be anything special when I went. So it appeared that you weren't missing much. Maybe I'm seriously underestimating them, but come on. I highly doubt it and feel that these would be acceptable to skip unless you just gotta cool down.

I never went to their water park here for several reasons. First of all, El Toro was calling me. Second of all, I can't think of any really amazing slides there, though I do keep hearing that they had something good as of recently, but what really is stopping me is #3. It's a seperate admission. Yeah, I just don't want to pay seperate for the water park. But if you do, go and tell me how it is.

Here are the reviews of all the Resteraunts at Six Flags Great Adventure. And I must admit, I was impressed with the dining selection here. Now granted, its still Six Flags food and you aren't gonna see Six Flags Great Adventure popping up on our <a href="Top10ParkFoods.html">Top 10 Theme Park Dining List</a> any time soon, but among the Six Flags parks, its easily the best. They had not only the typical amusement park crap, but they also had some chains such as Nathan's Hot Dogs and Ted's Cheesesteaks. Mmm. Cheesesteaks and Nathans *drool*. I really wish more of those chains would come to the other Six Flags parks. Now on a downside, they have a special place for a Freestyle Drink, however, when I tried to get one, I couldn't because they would only sell them to people who bought the Souviner Cups. What a stupid f*cking rule. Nobody was buying a freestyle drink. Completely empty. And when someone does want to buy one, oh no. You need a Souviner Cup. Screw you. Well, they still have a good dining option. Which is good, since you can't just head out and eat somewhere else due to its isolated location. =)

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Six Flags Great Adventure. As far as theming goes...it's Six Flags. I seriously hope you weren't expecting anything, cause you're certainly not gonna get anything. As for other attractions, it doesn't seem like they have all that much else to do other than roller coasters. Which isn't a bad thing considering their line up. But actually, they do have something else. A safari. Yes, that's right. There's a drive through Safari around Six Flags Great Adventure. And it's actually owned by the park. Not just some random safari near the park. So if you're into animals, then this is awesome news. Otherwise, you'll just have El Toro. Boo-hoo. =)

Six Flags Great Adventure is a great park to visit if you're into crazy roller coasters. I mean, come on. They have El Toro. One of the greatest roller coasters in the world. But not only that, but they also have Nitro, one of the better B&M Hyper Coasters, and many other really good roller coasters. And yeah. It's mainly a roller coaster park. Yes, they also have a cool safari, and a couple of relatively rare flat rides, but other than that, it's mostly just roller coasters. However, I am concerned about this park. This park really seems to be on the decline, with them constantly demolishing major rides. So yeah. My thoughts on this park have greatly declined due to their decline in rides, and.....not gonna lie. Their hardcore zipper intolerance that even extends into the lines also really hurts and makes visiting a pain in the ass. But even so. They do still have my favorite coaster of all time, and several other great coasters. So while it fell from one of my favorite Six Flags parks, El Toro still keeps it in the upper half (So help me if they decide to remove that). So definetly check out Six Flags Great Adventure. It's definetly one of the better Six Flags parks. And besides. Who knows what they'll demolish next.
