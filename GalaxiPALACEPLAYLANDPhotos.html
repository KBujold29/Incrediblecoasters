For today's review, we are heading back in time to review Galaxi at Palace Playland. Yep, it was just your typical snoozer Galaxi. Just get the damn credit and lets do something else. So you hopped in the cars, buckled your seatbelt, and you were off!!! You slowly rolled around a turn. Though you do got a nice view of Old Orchard Beach and the Atlantic Ocean before you began to climb the lifthill. After you climbed up the lifthill, you went through another slow turn, getting another great view of Old Orchard Beach. Then you headed down the first drop. It was a fun first drop, but nothing special. We then rose up a hill before we went through another turn. We rolled around the turn, taking a good luck at our surroundings (now would've be a great time for the rowing gag) before we dropped back down another drop. We gained some more speed and went right under the first drop, which actually gave us a nice headchopper effect before we rose up a small hill where there was a *tiny* amount of airtime. Seriously, it was nothing special. Then we went through a double helix. There was nothing particuarly exciting about this part of the ride. It didn't gain much speed or have many laterals, but it was fun to go crazy on this helix with friends. We then rose up a small little hill, but unfortunetly, there was a nasty trim here. LAME!!!!!!! We went through a small dip before rolling through another double helix. Again, it was fun, but nothing special. After gaining some speed from the double helix, we went through a slight turn, go through a dip, and went around a turn and rolled into the final brakes. This was just your ordinary Galaxi, and it was one of the lamer ones at that. It won't be missed.
