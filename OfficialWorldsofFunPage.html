When I first visited Worlds of Fun, I wasn't expecting too much. I mean, I expected to have fun and all, but I didn't expect to be blown away or anything. And while I wasn't blown away, it did exceed my expectations. The roller coasters that the park had were fun, Prowler, while not holier than though, is my favorite GCI. It had a decent flat ride collection, and suprisingly, had a really nice setting. The park had a lot more trees than most Cedar Fair parks and the shade will actually keep you cooler. Though you can tell that the park used to have even more trees back when it wasn't Cedar Fair, but still. Cedar Fair didn't totally strip the park of it's original theming and still has some small sections of theming, which was themed to the classic book, "Around the World in 80 Days". While there is still a lot of typical Cedar Fairness to Worlds of Fun such as lots of concrete, trash cans, and other typical Cedar Fair stuff, Worlds of Fun is still a really fun park that you should totally check out if you are ever in Kansas City.

Here are the reviews of all the Flat Rides at Worlds of Fun. Without a doubt, the best and most unique flat ride they have at Worlds of Fun would be Cyclone Sams. Now when you first hear what Cyclone Sams is, you immedietly say "THAT'S NOT UNIQUE OR ANYTHING SPECIAL!!!!!!" As Cyclone Sams is in fact, a Wipepout. See!!!! You just said it!!!! I know you did!!!!!! But it's not just a Wipeout, it's a very well themed wipeout. The ride is themed to you being caught inside a Tornado. They have cardboard cut outs of chickens and cows on the walls, as well as sound effects and the air conditioner blowing. While it's not Disney or Universal quality or anything, it is really well themed, and more importantly, it is sh*tloads of fun!!!!! =) So yeah. That's Worlds of Funs Star Flat Ride. I also rode their enterprise and their rotor. Their enterprise was fun as usual and had lots of positive Gs and their rotor totally made me miss Spin Out at <a href="OfficialSixFlagsMagicMountainPage.html">Six Flags Magic Mountain.</a> And those are just the flat rides I rode at Worlds of Fun. They also have an S&S Space Shot, a Top Spin, a Round Up, an Octopus, a Pirate Ship, a Scrambler, a weird flat ride that looked kind of cool, two carousels, two car rides, and a tiny little ferris wheel.

Without a doubt, the best Wipeout ever made.

While I never managed to ride any of them, Worlds of Fun seems to have an average water ride collection. They've got a small log flume that doesn't really seem like anything special, though it is in the shade, so even if you don't get wet, you'll still be cooling off. They also have a river rapids ride and a shoot the chutes ride, both seem average. So meh. Nothing to really brag about with Worlds of Fun's Water Ride Collection.

And then there's their water park. I can't judge since I never visited it, but I'm pretty sure that its a seperate admission, so you'll have to fork out some extra money if you wanna visit the water park.

Once again, Worlds of Fun has nothing special to talk about in this department. Our lunch that we got served was pretty much typical amusement park food. Now don't get me wrong, it was tasty and all, but it was nothing compared to the monster of a meal we had later that night at Lambert's Cafe (Though I will admit that I loved the free drinks after Prowler ERT). ;)

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Worlds of Fun. Now for theming, the park supposedly is themed after the book "Around the World in 80 Days". Though to be honest, I would've never known that if I wasn't told. You really can't see any connections to the book. I will admit that there is some light continenet theming as they have an Asia themed area and an Africa themed area. But Around the World in 80 Days is not the only book to feature multiple countries. Though by Cedar Fair standards, the theming in the Asia and Africa areas is actually pretty good. So give them credit there. And as for other stuff to do, there's not much. They probably have a couple shows or something, but I wouldn't know.

Worlds of Fun may not be the coaster capital of the world, nor may it be the Disneyland of the 21st Century, but it really is a nice Cedar Fair park. They have some good roller coasters such as Mamba, Patriot, and of course Prowler. The flat ride collection that the park has is decent and contains many fun flat rides. And by Cedar Fair standards, it has some good theming. So I'd definetly recommend Worlds of Fun to any coaster enthusiast. It's a fun amusement park that will keep you happy for the day.
