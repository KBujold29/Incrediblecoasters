Well, we made it past the border and are now in the beautiful city of Montreal.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
But who cares about that when there's an amusement park nearby.
</center>

<p>
<center>

<center>
My first park out of the U.S
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathLARONDE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up first is the lovely Goliath.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathLARONDE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Since helixes of death are illegal in Canada, they had to completely redo Goliath's Layout to make it Canadian approved.
</center>

<p>
<center>

<center>
Canadian Goliath > Californian Goliath 
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="boomerangLARONDE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After Goliath, we decided to go on a lower quality ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerangLARONDE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In French Canada, all Boomerangs are required to be sponsered by Chocolate Milk.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerangLARONDE3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Our ride on the Chocolate Milk Boomerang was quite good.
</center>

Here's a tip for those planning on going to La Ronde. Unless you've never been on a Vekoma Corkscrew, SKIP THIS RIDE!!! The operations are so horrible it's not funny! What should've been a 10 minute wait turned out to be a 90 minute wait!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermange2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As far as the actual ride, it was semi decent and not too rough.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign37.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn you Vekoma! Why did you have to make rides at stupid French Canadian Parks that will give the ride horrible operations!!!
</center>

When I was at the fair with Andrew <a href="VenturaCountyFair2008.html">last week,</a> he said that he'll be taking a vacation to Montreal and will visit La Ronde. I wonder why?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cobraLARONDE5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was Cobra. The old Stand Up Coaster,
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cobraLARONDE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Suprisingly, Cobra was great! It had everything you would want!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cobraLARONDE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It had a Vertical Loop,...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cobraLARONDE3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lots of twisty bits,...
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cobraLARONDE4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And ejector air! (And no, it does NOT hurt your balls in anyway.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cobragumsupport.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
Another thing we learned is that in Canada, Gum Supports are smiled at while they are frowned at in America.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vampire.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were going to go on Vampire next...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vampire2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

But the line was over 2 hours. So we decided we would come back to Vampire at the end of the day. (Or at least we thought we would.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monstre.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So instead we decided to go ride the Big Crappy Woodie.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monstre2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One thing we lucked out on is that we were one of the lucky few that were able to coaster race on Monstre. You French Canadians got your asses kicked!

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bathroomcandy.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is so awsome that they have candy machines IN THE BATHROOMS!!! Finally! I can eat my nerds while taking a crap!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathLARONDE4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to take another ride on Goliath because it's awsome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathLARONDE5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those Canadians are just enjoying their Canadian ride on Canadian Goliath in Canada.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathLARONDE6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it's no Maverick, it'a at least a fun ride in Canada.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vampire3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Earlier in the day, we decided to ride Vampire at the end of the day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vampire4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
However, they closed Vampires line because it was too close to the park's closing time. (IT WAS FREAKING 7:30 and the park closed at 10:00!!!!)
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="vampire5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Stupid Canadian Batman! You just HAD to be at this Canadian Park. Why couldn't you have been at Canadas Wonderland!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="toboggannordique.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If we're lucky, the Wild Mouse might be open.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="toboggannordique2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. We're sorry. The Wild Mouse is just too fun to be open this late at night.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marchedumillepattes.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After wandering the park for 15 minutes, we realized that the ONLY ride open in La Ronde was the Kiddy Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marchedumillepattes2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not that I'm a credit whore, it's just that this is the ONLY THING OPEN IN THE ENTIRE F**KING PARK!!!!!!!
