All right. Its time for our yearly fair visit and once again, I decided to head on over to the L.A County Fair and check out some of the cool stuff that was going on over there. And while there were no Doobie Brothers or Typhoon this year, I still had a blast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="lacountyfair5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to the L.A County Fair. We actually have good flat rides out here.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
"Check out my cool new pink sunglasses."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds50.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. The only bad part of the day was this god damn line. Man, I hated this stupid thing. It moved so slow and was filled with idiots including this one dumbass dad who spent 15 minutes bitching to the woman at the counter while his kid was running loose in the crowds. I really need to get a taser for situations like this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tango2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I spy with my little eyes the two rides we came here for. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tango3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep, Tango was back at this years fair and this year, I was actually able to get lots of rides in due to having more people with me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tango4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've said it before and I'll say it again. One of the craziest flat rides out there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. The other star flat ride at the L.A County Fair would be Speed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This flat ride is not only fast as hell, but it actually has some good flips. It almost seems like X2's first drop for pretty much the whole ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="gelato5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After my Europe Trip this summer, I'm never eating Gelato outside Rome again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="friedwatermelon3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I tried the Deep Fried Watermelon <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/LACountyFair2011.html">last year</a>. Meh, it was ok. But I've got much more insane stuff to try this year.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! A double decker carousel!!! We're here with our friend Alisa, a carousel enthusiast. So we had to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it really is one of the best carousels I've ever ridden.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="knightschool.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on Cody. You just know that you're the perfect age for Knight School (at least mentally). =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="chair.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Jolly Jolly Jolly. I'm King Cody. Now give me something good to eat you bloody twat!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cupcake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey!!! A cupcake from the cupcake stand ought to be really good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cupcake2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"One is not enough!!! Give me another one!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="frostingshot.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, I think we'd like to try a Frosting Shot. I mean, hey. Its just frosting. What can go wrong?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="frostingshot2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! THIS THING IS BOTH AMAZING AND HORRIBLE AT THE SAME TIME!!!! Its really good frosting, but at the same time, (I never thought I'd say this) but it's simply too much!!! Its too sweet!!!! It may not look like much in this photo, but Cody, Mac, and I split this thing three ways and I could barely finish my portion. It felt so disgusting and sweet and I wanted to run 10 miles just to burn off the assload of calories that thing had. That, and the fact that it gave Cody an insane sugar high that we should've medicated him for.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="friedcookiedough.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Because we're all dumbasses who are all gonna eventually get diabetes, we decided that a Frosting Shot just wasn't enough. So we got deep fried Cookie Dough on top of that. Holy Crap!!! One of the best deep fried foods I've had, but I was so full and over-sugarized that I could barely eat it despite its delicousness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="logflumeLAF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
A log flume at a fair? Sure!! Why not!!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="logflumeLAF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="funhouse3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for our first of MANY fun houses of the day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mirror5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Group Midget Photo everyone!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="funhouse4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What would a funhouse be without a little slide at the end? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantwheel2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, we're gonna ride the huge Ferris Wheel at the L.A County Fair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantwheel3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See!!! The cars are enclosed!!! That makes it fancy!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="experience.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is awesome!!! It's basically a sit down version of Tango on the ground, which is awesome by my standards. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="erinyo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. The falling star here is just a falling star. Next!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When you visit with a Carousel Enthusiast, you have to ride ALL of the carousels.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cobraLAF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. I already have this credit. I'm just sad and pathetic by nature.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnslide.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These slides are HORRIBLE!!! They aren't that fast and they felt uncomfortable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="zebra.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hows it going guys. I'm a zebra."

This is for everyone I know who suffers from a fear of spiders. =)

<p>

This thing is gonna snap and attack me any second now.

<p>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="owl.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Alisa made sure we spent at least 30 minutes today with this owl, who is now our newest friend.
</center>

<p>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="megadrop24.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I've been spoiled by Lex Luthor. I know its strong and has a good pop, but it just feels so small now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="zipper13.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
This year, the Zipper was mixed. Some of the time, it was running really lame. But one of our rides actually gave us 4 flips in a row and more. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyflyer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Why not take a ride on the Sky Flyer!!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyflyer4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It seems like a fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyflyer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Thats why. Its puny and has a crappy view.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="evolution2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Evolution was running pretty damn good this year.
</center>

<p>

<center>
<img src="littledipperLAF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

I had no idea that this existed last fair. So I'm glad that I managed to notice it this year and get an unexpected credit for me. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="littledipperLAF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

I'm so glad I decided to drag my bed to the fair. Now I can take the cat-nap I desperately need.
</center>

</center>
<center>
In case you can't tell, these aren't just ribs, but deep fried ribs. And yes, they really are freaking good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="moscowcircus2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to save the best fun house for last. The Moscow Circus.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="moscowcircus3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey!! Don't fall and f*ck yourself up like I did!!!

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to get a night ride on Speed now that the insane crowds are gone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="zipper14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I decided to take another Zipper ride since I got an insane 6 flips ride earlier. But this time, it was super lame with just one flip. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tango5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One last night ride on Tango (where Cody dropped his wallet, but luckily, a Carny caught it for him), and that concludes our crazy day at the L.A County Fair.
