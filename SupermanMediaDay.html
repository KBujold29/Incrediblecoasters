Well, I wasn't planning on heading back to Six Flags Magic Mtn until Westcoast Bash. But I got an invite to go to Superman Media Day and I simply couldn't pass it up. Oh, and here's a cool shot of Scream you can get from the Event Parking Lot.

For the event, they gave us these shirts. (And yes, they are backwards, and yes, they are supposed to be like that.)

"Hello. I am a clown. I am here to entertain you while you all wait for the park president to talk about Backwards Superman."
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder if they have enough stuff that says Superman: Escape from Krypton?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepodium.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To really make Superman Media Day special, they had an ice podium. How awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepodium2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh Crap!!! The Ice Podium is melting and knocked off the Microphone!!!! Who can save this media day from crumbling?"
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
This looks like a job for......DUCT TAPE!!!!!! 
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="pressbutton.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hmm. I wonder what this button does?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speech.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"In case you've been living under a rock for the past year, we now made Superman go backwards. We tried making it go sideways, but that didn't work out, so we had to settle for backwards."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speech2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Wow. You have no idea what my taste in fashion is."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pressbutton2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Kid!!!! Don't push that red button!!!! We already had one idiot try and push it earlier!!!! Don't go push the red..."
</center>

<center>
"Ahh Crap. Too late."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="confetti2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Quick!!! Somebody Contact Al Gore!!! Global Warming is getting worse!!! It now appears to be raining confetti!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape44.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They should've renamed it to Superman: Escape from Confetti. That seems to make much more sense for a name.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape45.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"RUN SUPERMAN!!!!! RUN!!!!!!!!!"

"What are you staring at? Is there something in my hair?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tram3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well that's a first. I've never seen the tram inside the park.
</center>

According to Cody, this goose is named Geoffry Sonic. To him, geese live forever.

<center>
Ohh. Shiney New Sign.

</center>
<center>

</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, the operations were horrible due to them setting up the cameras to film people. It was kind of like being back at Mt. Olympus. Except not nearly as sucky.
</center>

<p>

That's not a girl. That's just Cody wearing his cape.

Later on, we were able to marathon it since most people had already left. That was awesome. 
</center>

</center>
<center>
And we even got a ride on the tram back to Food Etc. Well, this was a really fun day. MUCH better than my typical crappy Wednesday Class Schedule. See you on Saturday for Westcoast Bash Six Flags Magic Mountain.
