After that fun night in a parking lot, we ended up back in San Francisco in the morning to see the sun rise over the Golden Gate Bridge.
</center>

 <p>

<center>
All right. First stop of the morning.
</center>

 <p>

We came back to the Golden Gate Bridge to walk across, but it was closed off to pedestrians since they were doing a San Francisco Marathon that morning. Oh well.
</center>

Oh sh*t. I think we came on a bad day. This place is full of fat loud obnoxious American Tourists.

Hey Alisa. Do you prefer the seals or the owls? =)

Another good shot of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Alisa is not going to be happy to find out that the carousel is closed. Next we'll be telling her that there are no owls on this trip.
</center>

Sorry Mr. Seal. Our car is full.

Hey Alex!!! Lets all go to Six Flags Discovory Kingdom today!!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
All right. This is a good place for breakfast. Hey, I approve of any place that sells Alligator shaped Sourdough Bread.
</center>

Is the crab eating shrimp borderline cannibalism? Hey, they're both in the Pleocyemata family.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="santacruzbeachboardwalk3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. Thats enough San Francisco for this trip. Time to hit up the theme park.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="santacruzbeachboardwalkentrance2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
It's about damn time we did a theme park on this trip considering the fact that we are IncredibleCOASTERS.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="doubleshot2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Finally got on the Double Shot here. MAN does it run a weak program.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipperSCBB8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
But thats not why we're here. We came to get more rides on the Santa Cruz Giant Dipper!!! =)
</center>

Warning. If you ever see an L.A Times Article on theme park or roller coaster news (excluding the possibility of some horrific accident, and take horrific accident with a grain of salt. Getting stuck on a lifthill is NOT a horrific accident *cough* California's Great America & Six Flags America *cough*.), automatically discredit it as made up bullsh*t.
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
It's funny. A month ago, we rode the Giant Dipper at Belmont Park. And now we're here. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipperSCBB10.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Definetly the best wooden coaster in California.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="closedrides6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
ARGH!!!! WHY DID YOU CLOSE THIS ENTIRE SIDE OF THE PARK!!! DAMMIT!!! NOW I CAN'T GET THAT KIDDY CREDIT!!!! Oh well. I'll just have to get it when I come back next year on our Nor Cal Trip.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="facepaint2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey. Why not have some fun and do the face paint.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="facepaint3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
"The facepaint. Isn't she a beautiful."
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="carouselSCBB.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And of course, since we're here with a Carousel Enthusiast, we just had to do the carousel! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="carouselSCBB2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
But hey. This carousel is awesome as its one of the few carousels that let you grab rings.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="carouselSCBB3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Feed the clown the rings so he can grow up big and strong and return the favor by eating you.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipperSCBB11.JPG">
</center>
<center>
So glad we stopped for this.

"GAH!!!! THE SEAWEED MONSTER HAS RISEN!!!! AND HE'S MAKING THE ENTIRE BOARDWALK STARE AT HIM AS HE WALKS BACK TO HIS CAR!!!!!" Seriously, this was an awesome weekend. Our first road trip was a total success. Now it's time for us to do Texas in 2013. =)
