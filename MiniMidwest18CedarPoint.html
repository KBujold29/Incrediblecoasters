All right. Time for another Incrediblecoasters Trip. Now, this is a smaller trip than we normally do. But to be fair, this is not only only trip, as we have two more trips this year, including the jackpot trip I've been trying to do for years (Japan is finally offically happening. It's all booked). But looking at Steel Vengeance, I knew that I had to find a way to also get to Cedar Point this year. So this trip went through so many different variations, with several different people. Hell, this was even considered a road trip for a brief amount of time, before that couldn't happen since...driving to Cedar Point is time-consuming, and...I've taken enough time off (You tend to take a lot of time off when you do 3 trips), and had to keep this short. And plus, when I saw that other friends were doing a similiar trip right around the same time I was going anyway, I joined them. And all right. We have all day before our Redeye Flight. So...here's some bonus pre-airport fun with us checking out the Van Eaton Galleries in L.A.

Mary Poppins bread! It's Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious! And it only contains a spoonful of sugar (OK. More like 10 spoonfuls, but who cares! It's freaking Mary Poppins Bread!). ;) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="citywalk2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
We still have plenty of time to kill before getting to LAX. Hmm. I wonder why we stopped at Universal Citywalk? What have they added that I've really been wanting to try?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="voodoodoughnuts.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're finally trying out Voodoo Doughnuts. I got two doughnuts to try (Oh, tip word of caution. The doughnuts are really cheap, but if you're thirsty and want a coke, WATCH OUT!!! That's where they get you. Don't learn the hard way like me).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="voodoodoughnuts2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
First off, the Voodoo Doll. As a doughnut, it's all right. Basically, take a generic chocolate bar, and turn it into a JELLY DOUGHNUT, and that's basically how it tastes. Good, but not my favorite doughnut. However, this doughnut is just so fun to eat. I love the theme of it. I love the way it looks. I love the way it comes with a pretzal stick that you use to STAB your voodoo doll, and make it bleed. I love eating off its limbs, before I decapitate it. Oh, who to make the voodoo doll!? Such a tough choice. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="voodoodoughnuts3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And I also tried the Grape Ape, since that one always caught my eye. It's basically like those raised Vanilla doughnuts with sprinkles. Classic that I always enjoy. Except for a couple things. #1. All the sprinkles are purple, fitting. And #2. What makes this the Grape Ape and not just the Purple Ape, is the fact that the doughnut is also covered in grape Koolaid dust. Damn. I love that. The grape dust really gives it a nice kick. You're enjoying the doughnut, tastes like a regular...BAM!!! Grape bite! And considering that I love the dust anyway, I was very happy to have it on the Grape Ape. I will be back as there are so many more flavors for me to try.

All right. Time for us to fly out to Cedar P...Detroit!? 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="airplane17.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Why the f*ck are we heading to DETROIT of all places?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sudoku.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Spirit Airlines. We're so cheap that you have to resort to your freaking boarding pass for in flight entertainment. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="dennys3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Ahh. Nothing says "Welcome to Detroit" by walking right by an abandoned and closed Dennys right upon arrival. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="henryfordmuseum.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Well, here's the main reason we flew out to Detroit.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="greenfieldvillage.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. So as I mentioned, this trip went through a million rewrites, and Michigan's Adventure was briefly considered before the plan was to just scrap Michigan all together. But a couple friends REALLY wanted to still do the Henry Ford Museum and Greenfield Village. So we figured that we could just fly into Detroit instead of Cleveland, and do those before heading down to Cedar Point.

You know, if we're gonna fly all the way out to Detroit, I feel like we should take some time and get to know the locals while we're here.

I know this invention was important and all, and it's great that this was the first invention that recorded sound. But my god.

Let's see what sort of food they ate in the 1800s.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="lunch67.jpg">

<center>
Meh. It's good, but the 1800s has better food at Silver Dollar City (I wish I was going there this year).

All right. Now let's actually check out the Henry Ford Museum itself.

All right. That's enough Henry Ford Museum. Time for the real reason we went on this trip to begin with. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="cedarpoint3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Yep. We have finally returned to Cedar Point. Considering that our last visit was <a href="ThrillCoastersCedarPoint.html">11 years ago</a>, we're long overdue to come back here.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="oceanmotion.jpg">
</center>
<center>
That name is misleading. Cedar Point is not on the ocean. It's on Lake Erie, which is a lake. If you wanna be accurate, call it "Lake Wake". That's a fitting name for a pirate ship. ;) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeper.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Let's start out our time at Cedar Point hitting up one of the coasters they've added since my last visit, Gatekeeper.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeperline.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. That line isn't nearly as long as it looks.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeper2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I'm hoping that this one of the better B&M Wingriders.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="locker2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Gee. I know a certain ride at a certain homepark that would really benefit from this instead of that stupid locker policy that just pisses guests off *cough* X2 @ SFMM *cough*. ;) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeper4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I'm happy to report that this is easily the best B&M Wingrider for one simple reason. The restraints don't constantly tighten throughout the ride. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPhEXHioqdw">B&M FINALLY FIXED THE PROBLEM!!! IT'S A MIRACLE!!!</a>
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeper5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Being able to breathe aside, it's pretty similar to the other Wingriders. Very floaty, very dependent on inversions, got a pretty view of Lake Eerie. Kind of bigger than the other Wingriders, but that honestly doesn't make much of a difference.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="gatekeeper3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
You know, I kind of liked those Dive Drops. I enjoy slowly turning upsidedown before dropping to the ground. Fun element. =)

Next coaster of the trip. Wicked Twister. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign571.jpg">
</center>
<center>
It seems like whenever I visit, no matter what, Wicked Twister never seems to have a long line. I like that.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="wickedtwister6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I really like Impulse coasters, and considering that this one is both bigger, and has a back spiral as well, I have a soft spot for Wicked Twister.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="wickedtwister7.jpg">
</center>

Seeing the park and beach of Lake Erie spiraling away, that's pretty cool.

OK. The lifthill and the first drop just looks like a giant triangle. Please tell me that I'm not the only one seeing that.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="corkscrew4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I was expecting complete sh*t. But not only did it not try to kill me, but it had a fun pop of airtime. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="corkscrew5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And it's very pretty going over the midway. Congratulations Corkscrew. You have exceeded my low expectations. Happy I got the credit this time.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="magnumCP5.jpg">
</center>

Figures that our next ride would also be another Arrow with triangle hills.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign566.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Magnum definetly deserves that. 
</center
	
 <p>

The rest of Magnum is fun and all, but the return airtime hills in the 3rd row, F*CKING BRUTAL!!! AND I LOVE IT!!!

Not only is it a fun ride, but we got to have ourselves a legit coaster race! You know those coaster races I portray in my reviews of any racing coaster, where I act like an overcompetitive jackass for fun. Except we actually did this in real life. And best of all, WE WON!!! WE WON THE COASTER RACE!!! IN YOUR FACE LOSERS!!! =P #TeamLongHair

<img src="valravn.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I think there was another B&M that Cedar Point added since my last visit. I wonder what that could be. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="valravn2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Cedar Point added a B&M Dive Machine.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="valravn3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And this isn't one of those Mini-Dive Machines that have been really popular recently, like Krake. No, this is a full sized, Sheikra style Dive Machine.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="valravn4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
In fact, this is the biggest Dive Machine of them all. And it's also got the most inversions, being the only Dive Machine with 3.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="valravn5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I know that this should be the best B&M Dive Machine, given how much more stuff it has. But, I do prefer Sheikra (Obviously, it's better than Krake). It's got a really cool layout. But there is one thing that makes me give the edge to Sheikra.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="valravn6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Vest restraints. Yep, it uses the same vest restraints that B&M usually reserves for their Flyers and their Wing Riders. While I've complained about the tightening problem the early Wing Riders used to have, I haven't really talked about the restraints in general. Since, I generally don't do that. But yeah. Let's talk about the vest restraints. They're fine for Flyers and Wing Riders. But on a Dive Machine, you wanna lean foreward. You want some room to move. Cause these restraints, even when not trying to choke you, they definetly hug you. It's like you're being hugged the entire ride. So on a dive machine, it kind of takes away a little bit of the intimidation factor. Not enough to enjoy it. I still really like Valravn, it's just that with the old restraints, throw in some cool African theming, and Sheikra gets the edge.

But first, let's check out Rougarou.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="rougarou3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hmm. This somehow feels new, and yet, I've done this before.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="rougarou2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. It's Mantis. They just renamed it, rethemed it, and turned it into a Floorless Coaster. Same thing they did with <a href="NorCal2017.html">Patriot @ CGA</a>.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="rougarou5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
On the one hand, Rougarou is a better ride. That is definetly true. That's the upside. But the downside is that now everyone is constantly screaming with every stand up coaster "FLOORLESS IT!!!". It's like converting them to floorless coasters is the new "RMC IT!!!" with some enthusiasts. NO!!! I really like Stand Up Coasters! I want more of them to be built! Not see the current ones get demolished or turned into floorless coasters! It's not so bad now since the ones they've touched so far are the meh ones. But my god. Don't you f*cking DARE think about touching Riddlers Revenge (Thank god for Scream) or Georgia Scorcher! >=( 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="rougarou6.jpg">

I will admit that it was cool to do an incline loop on a Floorless coaster though.

Oh yeah. We rode it in the front row, and at first, we thought it was raining on our ride. And yeah. It was raining. It just wasn't raining water. We got PELTED with insects during the ride. GAH!!! I couldn't even really enjoy the ride that much as I was preoccupied with protecting my face. Ugh. I forgot about all the bugs you have to deal with in the Midwest & South. >=(

Yep. We did Fastlane for our full day at Cedar Point. This park gets crowded, and we don't wanna waste any time in line. Besides, we want LOTS of rides on Steel Vengeance and Maverick.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>

Oh yeah. Time for us to finally do the coaster that drove me out to Ohio this year.

I know we just ran here, but sadly, there are technical difficulties. That sucks, but honestly, I'm just amazed that everything went perfectly smoothly after its...incident on opening day. But Cedar Point handled that beautifully, and if the ride opened up later that day after THAT happened, then it'll surely open up later today.

I know Maverick recently switched from the horsecollars to the vest restraints. I never had an issue with them (then again, I rode it opening year). But hey. I support this change.

Apparently, people like to sh*t on Gatekeeper. Hey, I like it. It's fun. Sure, it's far from amazing. Not anywhere close to being the best coaster ever, there are so many better coasters, but it's fun. There's nothing wrong with it.

We ate here for lunch. I was impressed that they actually gave me my meal for free because mine was delayed for so long. I know I complain about bad operations, and those apply to resteraunts as well. But them compensating my meal for the delay really shows that they care. Plus, a 10 minute delay is worth a $10 lunch.

I'm sure you all know that I'm no fan of the Windseekers. But the sheer fact that it's got a great view of all the rides at Cedar Point, as well as Lake Erie, EASILY makes this the best of the 3 Windseekers I've done.

I know that it's the worst of its kind, and it has a crappy layout. But it's still an Arrow Suspended, which are really rare nowadays (Why did they remove all the ones I didn't get to ride, and looked really cool). So it's still worth checking out.

Oh yeah. There still is ONE more credit for me left at Cedar Point (Technically 2, but one requires a kid, and I may be a credit whore, but even I draw the line there).

 <p>

You know, those giant Roller Skaters are actually fun. I'd probably ride more often if it wasn't in the kids area.

<center>
A week before the trip, I learned that Cedar Point had a special event going on, called "Brew & BBQ". So yeah. We naturally had to do it.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="brewbbq.jpg">
</center>
<center>
So many different BBQ foods to try. Looking foreward to going through as many as possible.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="brewbbq3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I have to highly recommend the Loaded Mac & Cheese with pulled pork and bacon. Mac & Cheese is great already, throw in bacon & pork, it's fantastic. Oh, and the wet Smokehouse Ribs with Chili Pecan are also fantastic. Of all the BBQ stuff I tried, these two were easily my favorites.

 <p>

<img src="cotton.jpg">

Dude! I've been seeing cotton flying everywhere at Cedar Point. It kept sailing in front of us at the Top Thrill Dragster station, and here, it just collects. I think some of it even got in my beer. That was annoying. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="brewbbq2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Damn you money! And damn you alcohol poisoning! If it weren't for the two of you, I'd drink all the beers! Now I have to actually choose which ones I want!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="beer10.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I went with the Blackberry Shandy, since yeah. I really like ciders. And yeah. It was fantastic. I assume you could get it in stores. I'd like that.
</center>
	 
 <p>

<img src="belt.jpg">

Boy! Six Flags certainly has improved since my last visit! Wait a minute. Something is not right here.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="beer11.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And of course, being a coaster enthusiast, I had to try the coaster beers. Because I'm a nerd like that! Plus, they're only at Cedar Point for a limited time. So first off, the Rougabrew. It was very good. Fairly mild, pretty malty, and was the kind of beer I'd sip while relaxing. Kind of reminded of something I'd order in Germany. So yeah. Rougarou, it's got a great beer.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="beer12.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And finally, we have the Valravn beer. It was all right. It had a good flavor, but it was more hoppy. Good, but not my favorite. So yeah. Valravn may be the better coaster, but Rougarou has the better beer. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="steelvengeance4.jpg">
</center>

We've been relaxing, eating BBQ, and drinking beer, having a great time. Let's make this even better and throw in some Steel Vengeance.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="brewbbq4.jpeg">

We even got dessert with these peaches and cream. It was good and all, well except for one problem. The cream also contained milk. Fine when actually eating it. But...milk has a terrible aftertaste. The good taste of fruit is gone, and that just leaves this gross aftertaste. It's bad to the point that I avoid cereal just so I don't get that aftertaste. Please tell me I'm not the only person who deals with that.

I know this may sound silly to say, but Cedar Creek Mine Ride isn't as good as it was back in 2007. I know it's just a mine train. But I initially thought it was on par with Goldrusher. But this time, it just felt slower and didn't have as much to it. Though I guess its a good thing that the biggest dissapointment of the trip was Cedar Creek Mine Ride.

You know, over the years, there's been a major backlash to years of people screaming that "MILLENIUM FORCE IS THE BEST RIDE EVER!!!", where people talk about how Millenium Force is overrated and trash talk the ride. And yeah. I admit that I don't think that the ride is amazing. I found Millenium Force overrated, and I trash talked the ride (Just go back and listen to me bash the lack of airtime). But the backlash has gotten so strong that I feel like I have to come out and reaffirm that despite me thinking that it's overrated and not the best ride ever, I do like Millenium Force. It is a very fun coaster, it has some great speed, and even a little bit of airtime. It's just mild airtime. That's all.

I know I go into more details in my just-published <a href="SteelVengeancePhotos.html">Steel Vengeance Review</a> (Seriously, go check out my Cedar Point review. I added reviews for all the new coasters, and I updated all the photos and information). But let me say this. Imagine that Twisted Collosus and Iron Rattler had a baby. Then you injected that baby with steroids, made it snort a line of coke, added a splash of crazy, and gave it a hunger for rape. That's Steel Vengeance for you.

It is just so mean, so brutal, so intense, and so aggressive. It's really one of the best coasters in the world. It's not just a <a href="Top10SteelCoasters.html">Top 10 Coaster</a>. It's a Top 5 Coaster. It's so good, it's right next to Maverick in ranking (Honestly, I think I rank Steel Vengeance above Maverick. And considering how much I LOVE Maverick, that's really saying something). I keep going back and forth as to whether this or Outlaw Run is my favorite RMC. It's just so amazing. I'm so glad I came out to ride this monster.

And finally, let's close out this Cedar Point visit with a ride on MaxAir. It's been forever since I did a Huss Giant Frisbee, and thought I should compare it to the Zamperla ones. Honestly, they pretty much felt the same. Which is fine with me. I absolutely love them. Looking foreward to one coming to my home park this summer. 
</center>
<center>
Thank you Cedar Point for another great visit. I had a blast. Steel Vengeance is unbelievable, the B&Ms you added since my last visit were fun, and I just had a blast being here. I really hope I won't have to wait another 11 years for my next Cedar Point visit again, cause this was awesome.
