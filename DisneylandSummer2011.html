All right. As you all know, the Disneyland Resort not only opened up the brand new Little Mermaid Dark Ride this summer, but it also redid Star Tours. So with two new experiences at the Disneyland Resort, we had to take a visit.
</center>

</center>
<center>
All right. What better way to start off the day than with a ride on Space Mtn?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtn63.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thank you Star Tours!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtn64.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And as always, Space Mtn was running really well.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Well, we might as well get it out of the way before it grows an insane line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="startours5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oops. Spoke too soon.

</center>
<center>
Hey. I'm just glad I was able to get this fastpass. When I came back, the fastpasses were for 10:00 PM.
</center>

<p>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhorn39.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

How about a quick ride on Matterhorn while we're here?
</center>

<p>

Suprisingly, Pirates actually managed to have a short line today.

C3PO will be leading us through the new Star Tours. Let's just hope that this isn't his first flight and he's still getting used to his programming.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="startours8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Star Tour's line is now looking snazzy! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="startours9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Poor Captain Rex is locked up in the freezer. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="startours10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This part of the line was really cool as people were walking through the screen.
</center>

"Quit bitching about spaceport security and accept your probing!!!! Hey, We still have more class than LAX!!!"

  <img src="startours12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
New Star Tours kicks ass!!! It flowed well and was a lot of fun!!! Never thought I'd say this, but great job C3PO!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="californiaadventure8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and those California Adventure letters, they're all gone. California Adventure now has an MGM Studios type of entrance, which looks really good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dlrconstruction25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That greetings from California Postcard is now gone as well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dlrconstruction26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* More construction at California Adventure!!!! I never would've suspected!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="californiaadventure9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Something tells me that this is the last you will ever see of the Golden Gate Bridge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dlrconstruction27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone know what that's going to be? I literally have no idea.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="storytellers26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In Incrediblecoasters Tradition, we had lunch at Storytellers, and it was really freaking good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!!! Now let's check out the Disneyland Resort's other new attraction. The Little Mermaid.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds36.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh boy. This is gonna be painful to wait for. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Luckily the ride has those never ending cars like on Haunted Mansion or Florida's Nemo, or else we'd really be screwed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So far, this is pretty cool!!! The under the sea party is pretty fun!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why is Ariel's hair made of play doh?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!!!! I remember you!!!! You were my teacher back in Middle School!!!! They'll hire just about anyone at that place!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littlemermaid8.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They kiss!!!!? They actually kiss after "Kiss the girl", LAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO DISSAPOINTED!!!!!!!! I was hoping to see a Super Sized Pallar..I mean Ursula get stabbed by that ship!!!! I can understand that that'd be pretty much impossible to recreate on the dark ride, but just kissing and having no real conflict, HOW F*CKING LAME!!!!!! It'd sort of be like if on Snow White, after seeing the Evil Queen turn into the hag to get Snow White, Prince Charming just comes along and takes Snow White away while the Queen just shrugs and says "Dammit!!! I'm too late!!! Oh well." Come on Disney!!!! You could've at least brought Vanessa into the ride!!!! Oh well. At least the anamatronics looked freaking amazing.

Never thought I'd see Corn Dog Castle getting a makeover.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mullhollandmadness30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And speaking of Makeovers, Mullholland Madness just finished it's makeover and is now known as Goofy's Sky School.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mullhollandmadness31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! They still have the single riders line for it!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mullhollandmadness32.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. While it didn't make it any better, it's not any worse either. It's still just plain old Mullholland Madness, only painted white.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="californiaadventure10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn!!! That new eating area looks NICE!!!!!!

Thanks to the magic of Single Riders Lines, we were also able to make it on California Screamin today as well.
</center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="aladdinshow2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<p>
<center>
  <img src="aladdinshow3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This show was actually really awesome. The acting was really good, and the Genie made me laugh quite a few times. Definetly recommended.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterror30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
