All right. Time for another visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain. Now, I ended up not going to Six Flags Magic Mountain FAR LESS than I originally anticipated due to being broke and busy. Ugh. So yeah. I never really had time to go to Six Flags Magic Mountain. And honestly, my former time working there still sort of had me burned out on the place. So I just kept thinking "Ugh. I'll go back to SFMM whenever." Cause yeah. Until today, the last time I visited was <a href="TwistedCollosusDay.html">when Twisted Collosus opened</a>. So yeah. I definetly felt that another visit was overdue. I wasn't even originally planning on making this an update until I realized "Oh wait! I haven't been going to SFMM recently. This isn't an everyday occurance!". And that break definetly helped as I really had fun today. All right. Let's move on and start the day with Goliath.

<img src="goliath110.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be the best ride or anything, but it's just a really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosusline2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goliath is fun and all, but let's move over to the really good rides. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosus17.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It's time for some more Rocky Mountain goodness. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosus18.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There is just so much airtime, laterals, and other crazy sh*t that makes this ride SO GOOD!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosus19.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! TWISTED COLLOSUS IS DUELING!!! KICKASS!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream108.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And hey. While we're here, why not take a ride on Scream.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream109.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Grr. Scream was technically running two trains, except they're only loading one of them. I F*CKING HATE IT when they do that!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream110.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure why the hell Scream is so fun, but it just is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream111.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ROAR!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="greenlantern36.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, it's been forever since I last rode Green Lantern. Let's go for a ride on that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="greenlantern37.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! This ride is absolute GARBAGE compared to Insane. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign429.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you need me, I'll be at Pancho's Bar getting drunk and bitching about how I miss Grona Lund.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign430.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Happy to hear that they'll be doing Holiday in the Park again this year. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="revolution29.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After so many years of waiting and hoping for the OTSRs to come off Revolution, I finally got my wish!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="revolution30.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm so looking foreward to getting on this ride again. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign432.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Never have I been this happy to see a ride at SFMM closed. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ninja38.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Do not ignore Ninja. It's not only a really fun ride, but it also is getting pretty rare as the Suspended Coaster becomes a dying breed. =( And in other random news, Jet Stream is closed today. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermantheescapeline4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, the park suddenly got busy today. Nope. Not going to wait for that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="riddlersrevenge114.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Single Riders Line for this ride is always a god-send. And hey, Riddlers is always a fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="terminator78.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Terminator is getting rough, but it's not as bad as people claim its getting. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign431.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Considering how many stupid ads there are plastered all over Six Flags parks, at least this is for something in Six Flags Magic Mountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tatsu66.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, I normally don't talk much about Tatsu. And yeah. I normally avoid Tatsu since I tend to move over towards other rides I like more and by the time I get to Tatsu, it always has a long line since you have to get to Tatsu early in the morning if you don't want to wait in too long of a line. It's been a LONG time since I've ridden this ride. Hell, I've ridden freaking Outlaw Run and Iron Rattler more recently than Tatsu!!! Yeah!! Last time I rode Tatsu was before the <a href="TRTLasVegas.html">Texas/Rocky Mtn Road Trip</a> back in 2013. Yeah, I'm overdue for another ride on Tatsu and will have to make the trek early in the morning.

Ooh. Love the decorations they're putting up the decorations for Holiday in the Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>

<center>
Looking foreward to seeing this all lit up tonight.

If a coaster ever warns you that you have to take out your earrings, be afraid. Be very afraid.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="X114.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! It's the sweet spot!!! Time for X2!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="Xline13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
MARATHON!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosus20.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, they finally replaced the Collosus mural with the Twisted Collosus mural. Sweet!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flame.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did anyone bring a giant bag of marshmellows to the park?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign433.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

<center>
YOU SHALL NOT PASS!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twistedcollosusline3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Twisted Collosus may have a line now, but it's not that bad. Plus, it's not like we can do much else in the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride83.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, there's no line at all. Let's go for a couple rides on Batman.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride84.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Still one of the strongest B&Ms out there. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="holidayinthepark10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! The sun has set and now all the lights get to come on. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="holidayinthepark11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It looked great <a href="SFMMsHolidayinthePark14.html">last year</a> and it looks just as good this year.
</center>

<p>

Riddlers Revenge vs. Green Lantern. FIGHT!!!!

<img src="sandblasters7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh...why the hell did I decide to ride this?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign435.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
F*CKING LAME!!! I DON'T CARE WHAT SORT OF SAFETY BULLSH*T YOU TRY AND COME UP WITH TO JUSTIFY!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTNP792ykYM">THIS IS STUPID!!!</a> YOU HIT PEOPLE ON BUMPER CARS!!! THAT IS THE WHOLE F*CKING POINT!!! GET RID OF THE RULE OR GET RID OF THE RIDE YOU STUPID F*CKING IDIOTS!!!!
</center>

<p>

I really love all that they've done with the trees.

<img src="roaringrapids11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! IS ROARING RAPIDS OPEN!!? WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!!!? For those who don't know, I used to work at SFMM and Roaring Rapids was my ride (P2 is not a bad place to be honestly). Now Roaring Rapids was a seasonal ride. It'd open around Spring Break and close right on Halloween. During the off season, when most parks are closed, Rapids would be closed as well, and I'd have to work at either X2, Viper, or in Bugs Bunny World, none of which are as good as Roaring Rapids. So seeing Rapids open when it should be closed for the season is pretty shocking to me, and that's why I'm dumbstruck at something that most people wouldn't think twice about.

I seriously am just so impressed with all the lights SFMM has put up. It really looks great.
