Well, we're here at our first port stop. Time to hop off the ship (I see you Aqua Dunk).
</center>

 <p>

<center>
We made it to Naples, Italy. Hi Patrick. How's it going? =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="boat.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Well, after spending the past two days on a ship, the first thing we want to do after naturally getting off the ship is get onto a much smaller boat. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>

Bye Naples. It was nice being in your town for 5 minutes.

Yay!! We made it to the island of Capri! =)

I know I mentioned it <a href="TPRFiabilandia.html">before</a> and I'll say it again. These pharmacies just SCREAM "MEDICAL MARIJUANA STORE!!!!" to me. I can't undo that connection. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="alcohol19.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Limoncello and Liola Crema are the two popular liquors in this part of Italy and we got a free shot of each. It's good and all, but I will warn you. These things are STRONG and have a HIGH alcohol percentage. So be warned. It burns going down.

You know what? Let's all go and check out a city destroyed by molten lava. Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
</center>

♫But if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like nothings changed at all?♫

A big old mass grave.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pompeii4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Even in the ancient city of Pompeii, they had water fountains. Come on Northern Europe! Get your act together on this!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pompeii5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
It's just a really cool place to walk around.
</center>

 <p>

Apparently, this was sort of the ancient version of Fast Food. Guess McDonalds isn't so special after all.

Ooh. More pretty artwork from the Disney Ship.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="animatorspalate.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for the final resteraunt on our dining rotation, Animator's Pallate.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="picture88.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I just LOVE the theme and atmosphere of this resteraunt.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="animatorspalate2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
If I was judging all the resteraunts I've been to solely on the atmosphere, and experience, and not including food (Don't get me wrong. The food was really good. There's just better), Animator's Pallate would easily be in the Top 5.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="appetizer2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hey, it's a really good appetizer.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="soup.jpg">
</center>
<center>
This Baked Potato or Mac and Cheese Soup...I forget exactly which it was. All I know is that it's REALLY good. Screw the fact that it's an immature food that popular with kids. I don't give a f*ck. I love it.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="dinner23.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And hey. The pasta they had was really good.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="animatorspalate3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
At the end of dinner, they had Fantasia Mickey come out after a show on the screen and the waiters and waitresses followed him and celebrated. Hey, fine with me. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="dessert14.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Fun fact about this dessert. I ordered this "Make Your Own Pie" dessert, and was warned by the waiter that it wasn't really good and that I should try something else. But I figured "F*ck it. I like most things. I'm sure it'll be fine". Got it, and...I wasn't a fan of it. So take it from me, if your waiter/waitress recommends something else, take their advice. They know what they're talking about. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign417.jpg">
</center>
<center>
After dinner, I went and saw the "Twice Charmed Show". I saw the begenning, but fell asleep during the middle, waking up to And They Lived Happily Ever After again. Dammit!! Oh well. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>

Aww. How cute. A little towel bear.

Another day. Another port in Italy.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="piazzanavona5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're in Rome. I had actually <a href="TPRRome.html">been to Rome before</a> and I absolutely loved the city. So I was more than happy to go back here again, and see a new side of the city. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>

If your mind is as dirty as mine, then you're seeing what I'm seeing. =)

</center>
<center>
Love just how pretty and elaborate the water fountains are in Rome.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="building5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
If you love coffee, then this is a nice little cafe to stop in.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pantheon5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
In a repeat of 2012, we went and stopped at the Pantheon again.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pantheon6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yes. It's still very nice looking 3 years later.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="waterfountain9.JPG">
</center>
<center>
If you see a water fountain in Rome, drink up. They're sadly not nearly as common in the rest of Europe (particuarlly Northern Europe).
</center>

 <p>
<center>

<center>
Is there a reward for turning in Copyright Infringement cases to Disney? =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="trevifountain4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
We're back at the Trevi Fountain, and sadly, it's all dried up for rennovations. Well, at least I got to see it <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/trevifountain.JPG">full</a> last time.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="trevifountain5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
But don't worry. There may not be any water, but you can still waste your money here.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="trevifountain6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
So many wasted Euros.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="gelato7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We're in Rome. We HAVE to get some Gelato. We HAVE to.
</center>

 <p>
<center>

<center>
Best Ice Cream ever. Not joking.

Oh look. We're back at the Spanish Steps. And unlike last time, I'm actually climbing up.
</center>

 <p>

</center>
<center>
It's nice and all, just look out for people pulling <a href="https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/theft-scams/tourist-scams">the Friendship Bracelet Scam</a>. While I wish I was more rude to the scammer and called it a scam to his face, I am happy to report that I didn't give him a single Euro. =)

Time for lunch at a little hole in the wall place.
</center>

 <p>

This may not be sterotypical Italian, but they recommended their beef, and it was good. Not complaining. =)

Hey David. How's it going?

Hey look. It's that really fancy McDonalds with the Gelato that they showcased on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XLQ4EXi4Ss&t=7m18s">Most Unusual McDonalds</a>. Cool.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="vatican2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yep. I'm back in the Vatican, and now there's a new pope. Does he seem like a nice guy? Yes. Is he an improvement from the old pope? F*CK YEAH!!! Is he perfect? No. Does he change the fact that I'm a staunch atheist? Nope.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sistinechapel.JPG">

This time, I actually spent more than 5 minutes in this itty bitty little theocracy. Even saw the Sistene Chapel since I might as well while we're here.

</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another dinner on the ship. And I'm sorry, but I didn't like this appetizer. It's duck something, but I forget what part of the duck, All I know is that I didn't like it.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="soup2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Ahh. That Black Bean Soup washed it all away.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="dinner24.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This steak was really good, and apparently everyone else wished that they ordered it instead of whatever chicken/fish/turkey everyone else ordered cause they vowed to always order what I got afterwards and even called me a foodie. I'm flattered, but I would not call myself a foodie. I'm lots of crazy, weird, and random things, but a foodie isn't one of them. Granted, I do love food and all. Eating is awesome. But if I tried to pass as a foodie, a real foodie would kick my ass.

</center>
<center>
Tonight's show was Villians Tonight. Now, I actually knew about this show in advance, and was looking foreward to seeing it. Cause I LOVE the Disney Villians, absolutely adore them. So this show was screaming my name. Yeah, it's silly. It's stupid. It's cheesy. But I liked it and was glad that I saw it.

I think there's some sort of law that states every place in Italy must be pretty. Been twice and to lots of different parts, and I loved every inch of the country.

As the official foodie of our table, I must say. The lamb chops were indeed quite tasty and well cooked.
