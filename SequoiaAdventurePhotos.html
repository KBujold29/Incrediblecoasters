For today's review, we're going back in time to my visit to Gardaland in order to review one of the weirdest, strangest, most unique, most pointless, dumbest coasters to have ever existed. Sequoia Adventure. No really, this ride was INCREDIBLY STUPID!!! I might just put this on my Top 10 Most F*cked Up Coasters List when I make it. For you see, Sequoia Adventure was an S&S Screaming Squirrel. A bizarre little contraction that has no other purpose than going upsidedown, and now with this ride gone, there's only one other Screamin Squirrel left in the world at some park in China. Considering that they have an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6QIcX86waY">Intamin Rocket Coaster</a>, there's a decent chance that that park (Mysterious Island) will be included in a future Incrediblecoasters China Trip. Then another sort of weird Screamin Squirrel-like ride was built in Russia, and that turned out to be the prototype for the S&S El Loco, which has proved to be an awesome type of ride as it's demonstrated <a href="SteelHawgPhotos.html">multiple</a> <a href="ElLocoPhotos.html">times</a>. But while those are awesome rides, we're here to review Sequoia Adventure, the Screaming Squirel. *groan* Let's just get this ride over with. We got in the cars, pulled down the lap bar and the OTSRs, and off we went. We went around this really awkward turn since this was one of those rides that technically can't do any laterals, kind of like one of those Japanese Ultra Twisters. Except while <a href="UltraTwisterPhotos.html">Ultra Twister</a> is awesome (REALLY hope to ride the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjn6ELuH3xg">Dive Loop Ultra Twister</a> on my next Japan Trip). The only difference is that while Ultra Twister is a really fun ride, this ride SUCKED DONKEY BALLS!!! But thanks to this really weird side track, it could make the necessary turn. And it felt weird. Kind of like the turnaround on Perilous Plunge. Except where that led us to an awesome drop with ejector air, this just lead us to the lifthill of a strange and stupid roller coaster. Anyways, we went up the lifthill, got a good view of Gardaland and Lake Garda and went down this straight track that just seemed to lead to nowhere. It just dissapered. It actually was a really cool look. We just got closer and closer to the edge until...STOP!!! Uh...hi. Why the hell are we stuck here? Is the ride broken? There's no cars down below. We aren't stopped because of a block brake. What the hell are we just stopped at an awkward 45 degree angle for!!? Well, we moved on and flip. Congratulations. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G31657URsY">We are now upsidedown</a>. So yeah, there's not any real reason for us being upside down. We just sort of are. And then we flip back to being rightside up. Now, a lot of people complain that this part of the ride is painful. I personally never found that to be the case. So unless boredom and frustration from stupid pointlessness is considered painful, then no. This is not a painful ride. Anyways, we stop. Inch along, ready to flip again and...GOD DAMN IT!!! STOP STOPPING US RIGHT HERE!!! Ugh, you're wasting my already wasted time. Well, we flip upsidedown. I would warn everyone to not leave stuff in their pockets on this ride. But I have a better idea. How about you just keep your stuff in a zippered pocket. You see, while stuff can fall out of a normal pocket and this is a prime example of a ride that'll shake you down. A zippered pocket has teeth that prevents the pocket from opening up, and keeping the conents inside secure, regardless of whether you're flipping around, on a vertical lift, or even just being upsidedown on this peice of sh*t, zippered pockets will keep your stuff secure. You can cry and scream about saftey all you want (you can even go ape-sh*t and just completely LOSE IT over this like a few <a href="OfficialUniversalOrlandoResortPage.html">certain</a>  <a href="OfficialTokyoDomeCityPage.html">parks</a> have done), but that still doesn't change the fact that your stuff will be secure in a zippered pocket and any park that tells you otherwise is full of sh*t. So please buy Zippered Pockets today. Oh wait, I just went off on a tangent. Sorry, I've always been VERY passionate on this topic. Anyways, let's get back to the coaster, even though it's really not that interesting. We're upsidedown, and I mean just CRAWLING. WHY ARE WE GOING SO SLOW!!!? We started to un-flip and...STOP!!! NO!!! NOT AGAIN!!! Well, it didn't last long and we even went over a little bump. Hey, that'll spice this up. And for once, we don't stop. We just flipped upsidedown. HOORAY!!! And of course, we did nothing while upsidedown other than crawling at a snail pace. I swear to god, this was a coaster designed around being like Upsidedown Girl from Recess. And sure enough, we flipped back. We're rightside up, on the ground, and the ride is over. Just went around another awkward turn and through some straight track. So, would I have recommended this ride? Uh...as much as it may sound strange considering all that I've said, Yes. I know that sounds weird after all the bad things I've said about this ride. It was stupid. It was pointless. But despite all that, one thing still didn't changed. It's unique. There really aren't any coasters like it. It may be sh*t, but I am a sucker for rare and unique rides. I just have to ride them. And now with this ride now gone, its clone in China is EVEN MORE UNIQUE as now that's the ONLY ONE left in the entire world. And I will grant the ride this as well. I really hope some other ride uses the flip as part of a much bigger experience as ling as they don't stop it like they do here. It's a cool element that I could really see put to creative use on a more complete ride. But hey, we have El Locos, and I'm happy with those. I know I'll ride its clone in China since....I need that credit (assuming it doesn't get demolished before I make it out there). But yeah. If you don't care about getting credits or unique experiences, then you didn't miss much with this ride.
