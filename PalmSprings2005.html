Ahh. Surf Rider Rapids. The star attraction of Soak City Palm Springs! I'll give you a mini tour of the ride.

   </center>
   <center>
It starts out with a few small drops and a few turns.
   </center>

   <p>
   <center>
       <img src="surfriderrapids3.jpg">
   </center>

   <center>
Then it digs into a ground hugging helix. You can see Surf Rider rapids makes good use of the terrain.
   </center>

   <p>
   <center>
       <img src="surfriderrapids4.jpg">
