</center>
<center>
Well, that wonderful time of year has come again, and Westcoast Bash is in the air. This year, Westcoast Bash kicked some serious ass and was chock full of suprises. For instance...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sfmmpresentation.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"We have removed the OTSRs from Revolution for the day!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doughnuts4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We all got fooled by that. But they still had the awesome doughnuts.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doughnuts5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"GRR!! I'M THE DOUGHNUT MONSTER!! GIMME SOME MORE DOUGHNUTS!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And we also had Morning ERT on X2!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X71.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"All they need to do now is bring the sea of doughnuts into X2's station."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sfmmempty2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Aren't there supposed to be like 700 people at this event?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tatsu56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to give Tatsu a ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tatsuline3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now this is how ERT should be.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninja26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Ninja won't be open today. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator44.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like we'll just have to settle for Terminator instead.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="knockdoor.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Housekeeping. My name is Hans and I'm here to make your bed."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="preshow.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ha Ha! The Preshow got stuck!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dejavu33.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was the only time we ever saw DejaVu run today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mrsixsdancecoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For our first backstage tour, we got a look at Mr. Six's Dance Coaster's Dirt Lot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dejavu34.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And some really kickass hidden angles. Too bad DejaVu stopped running. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mirror2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Photo of me nerding out during the backstage tour."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dejavu35.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Run Dammit! Run!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buddah.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Buddah. How does it feel to have your home invaded?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator45.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well at least Terminator is running. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mrsixsdancecoaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Track for Mr. Six's Dance Coaster has arrived! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator46.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
From this angle, Terminator actually looks pretty big.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator47.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"They took the Tunnel."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator48.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Terminator Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving on with our backstage tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge88.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We now present some rare Riddlers Revenge Angles.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge89.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yummy Dive Loop Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge90.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There's not that much airtime right there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride57.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up is Batman the Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride58.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
We're in a backstage tour taking rare and amazing photos of Batman! What more do you need to now?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge91.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First Drop Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride59.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can somebody please explain to me why Batman has those sleeves and who's the guy who thinks they look good?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride60.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Too bad there's no train in this shot. But it still kicks ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge92.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First Drop Goodness from another angle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride61.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All those great shots of Batman made me want to go ride Batman. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantherideline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Andrew. Don't get sick."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride62.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Needless to say, nobody got sick today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath71.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next would be Goliath.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Crap! It got CROWDED today!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="screamline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Luckily, Scream NEVER has a long line, no matter how crowded it is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream63.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see cars in this picture. That's not good. Oh well. We've got ERT, so it really doesn't matter.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yosemitesamsierrafalls2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To kill some time, Cody, William, and Andrew decided to take a spin on Sierra Falls.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yosemitiesamsierrafalls3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"We arn't scared of getting wet. We're just scared of that Black Widow that was in our raft!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Then it was time of our Westcoast Bash lunch. Which as always, was very tasty.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icecream4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"We need more Blue Bunny Ice Cream in California."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scavengerhunt2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for this year's Scavenger Hunt. And this year, we know to look under the trash cans. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="plaque.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
One of the things in the Scavenger Hunt was a little something called "The Evil Paragraph." (It really was evil!) Basically, they gave us a giant list of words in alphabetical order and we had to read this plaque, and cross off every word that was on the plaque and answer the question created from the remaining words. And keep in mind that we only had 1 hour and 15 minutes to do this as well as all the other stuff in the Scavenger Hunt. Well, me being the genius I am, thought it would be smart to take a picture of this plaque and read it from my camera. Well, I probably spent 30 minutes reading that fu*king thing and only made it to the first paragraph. And I had to move around while doing this because we couldn't split up this year.  I eventually gave up in order to keep my sanity. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream64.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After the Scavenger Hunt, we had a Scream Backstage Tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream65.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was really freaking amazing!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream66.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As you can see, we got to get up close to Scream. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream67.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Vertical Loop Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream68.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is why Backstage Tours are really freaking amazing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bolt.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I don't care about all these awesome shots and cool angles. I'm just happy that I have my very own Scream Bolt!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream69.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This photo is basically eye sex. It is so beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When have you ever seen this angle of the first drop?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream71.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Final Dip Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream72.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That was awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus39.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was a Collosus Backstage Tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus40.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It wasn't nearly as amazing as the Scream Backstage Tour since I got most of those Collosus Shots in the Parking Lot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tractor.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Can we please have Night ERT on the Tractor?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign109.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now it's time for the Q&A with Tim, Neil and Jay (I found out some really interesting stuff here).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape25.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Superman wasn't going that high today, but it was still awesome during Night ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="float7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What do you mean this isn't the 101 Freeway!? Damn! I guess those old people can't drive rumors are true!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign110.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So that's why it was so crowded today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like the Physics Day kids overheard Neil's joke about the removal of Revolution's OTSRs. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstream7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to settle for a ride on Jet Stream.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstreamline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey! You learn Physics in boring classrooms! Not on log flumes! Get back in your classrooms and back to work!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstream8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I was not amused about getting wet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign111.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like we won't get on Tidal Wave.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Never mind.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After Jet Stream, I really didn't feel like going on Tidal Wave (Though I did ride it earlier this morning).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="geese5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
According to Cody, this goose's name is Geoffrey Sonic. To him, geese live forever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I totally forgot how much I love to soak myself on Tidal Wave's Bridge. I should start doing it alot more often."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPLASH!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="layline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Westcoast Bash is really tiring me out. I need a Dirt Nap.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sandblasters5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey! There's no bumping allowed on the bumper cars!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="longhornBBQ2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For dinner, we decided to eat at Longhorns BBQ.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="longhornBBQ3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You Fail.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="longhornBBQ4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Grr! I'm losing my mind at Longhorns BBQ! This is not BBQ sauce! It's blood! Gimme your soul!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="longhornBBQ5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In all seriousness, Longhorns is awesome. The food is totally awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride63.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Jay was right. This is the prettiest part of SFMM.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="swashbuckler6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Later, we decided to take a ride on Swashbuckler.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goofy5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What the hell is going on here?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fail.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You fail.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="swashbuckler7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh Crap! I didn't think this was a Starflyer!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thomastrain2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to take a ride on Thomas, just for the hell of it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thomastrain3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
NERDS!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thomastoys.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Many lives were claimed today when a series of trainwrecks were caused by a couple of evil giants.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="balloons7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We spun the living crap out of the Balloons. And it was awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flightschool.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. We conquered the Flight School.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="daffystourbus3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We even put ourseles on the Short Bus.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="daffystourbus4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it wasn't nearly as crazy as when <a href="16thBdayParty.html">Cody, Isaac, Alisa, and I rode this</a>, it was still decent. (Oh yeah. And thank you Bugs Bunny World Ride Operators for taking our pictures.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's enough Bugs Bunny World. Let's instead lose our sanity with this merchandise.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wolf vs Crocodile. FIGHT!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"GRR!! I'M A KILLER WHALE!!! I LIVE AT SEA WORLD!!! GIMME SOME FLESH...I MEAN FISH!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Check out my Sea Anenome Glove.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I have the strangest feeling that someone is watching me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandcarousel.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now onto a carousel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Canyon Blaster had the best operations. First, the ride operator made everyone scream as loud as they could, then each person had to individually scream as loud as they could, and we had to be screaming during the ride. It was actally awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I WANT MY MOMMY!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nightERT3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Night ERT has begun! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus41.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it may seem that Collosus was the same as always...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus42.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Collosus was actually racing tonight!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus43.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We're going to win this coaster race for sure.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator49.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They also gave us a completely special Westcoast Bash Soundtrack for Terminator.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator50.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What do you mean you got to skip the preshow!? Everybody must go back and watch the preshow!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dejavu36.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, DejaVu was still closed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goldrusher31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We rode Goldrusher during ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge93.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As well as Riddlers Revenge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescapeline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Superman was running quite well for Night ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="Xline7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And how else do you finish this update than with Night ERT on X2? Westcoast Bash kicked ass this year and I'm sure 2011 will be even better!!!
