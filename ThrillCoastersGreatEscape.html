  Well, my big trip of the year was here. It started out great with a suprise park which turned out to be the Great Escape.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign35.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's great for Friends. But we don't care. We have credits to get.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Anyways, how else do you start a big trip other than immedietly getting your 100th Credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerangGREATESCAPE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of all the rides my #100 could've been, it had to be a Boomerang.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerangGREATESCAPE3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On a positive note, this is the best Boomerang I've ridden so far. There wasn't a single moment of roughness on the ride.
</center>

<p>

<center>
I'm not attracted to him or anything. I've just got nothing better to do.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="canyonblasterGREATESCAPE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was Canyon Blaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblasterGREATESCAPE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the ride is completely crappy, at least it briefly sprinkled on our crappy ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Finally! The real reason we bothered to come here!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you're a fan of airtime and sharp turns, then the Comet is a ride for you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was so worth stopping off the side of the road to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinebobsled.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After getting on Comet, Alpine Bobsled opened up for us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinebobsled2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
This ride would've been alot more fun if it wasn't braked so heavily.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinebobsled3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Another low factor in the Alpine Bobsled was the fact that you had absolutely NO leg room.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinebobsled4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Alpine Bobsled from the Ferris Wheel.
</center>

</center>
<center>
Just in case you forgot where we were, here's the sign. (Don't be emberresed if you actually forgot where we were. It's not like there's anything aside from Comet here.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="aliceinwonderlandGREATESCAPE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure why, but it appears that people on this trip enjoy turning into midgets.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="aliceinwonderlandGREATESCAPE2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Does Disney know about this?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="condorGREATESCAPE.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They have a condor at the Great Escape. But we didn't ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steamindemon.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Instead we decided to get the final credit we needed here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steamindemon2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike the Boomerang, Steamin Demon is rough and craptacular.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steamindemon3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
However, it wasn't so bad compared to the Arrow Death Machine at the other suprise park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, since we conquered the Great Escape, there was nothing left to do but to ride Comet til we had to get back on the bus.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here you can see some of the sharp turns on the ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is filled with airtime unlike the crappy woodie at my home park. (Hopefully their 2009 woodie will change that.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cometGREATESCAPE7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After realizing that we were doing nothing but riding Comet, the park closed early and we had to get back on the bus. But I enjoyed Great Escape and will someday come back for the Comet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="unos.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After learning that Deep Dish Pizza is the best food to eat after riding an awsome woodie, we had to eat at Unos.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
I can do this amazing trick not because I'm talented, but because I'M GOD!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign36.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, we will go to Oiho on this trip. But first, we're going to attempt to get past the border, and if we succeed, then we'll be in Canada!
