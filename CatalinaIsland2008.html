Basically, this is the story. We were running late, but we wanted a quick lunch. So we stopped at Coyote Joes. We got drinks, I drank a Coke. But before they came back to take our order, we saw the time and noticed that if we didn't leave NOW, we'd miss our tour, so we just booked it and left. Technically, we did get drinks, but yeah. Thats the end of that. Someday, I must go back and eat there for the meal that was never meant to be. =)
