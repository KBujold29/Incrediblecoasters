We're here at Kings Island. Today's ride we'll be reviewing for you is Bat. Now Bat is one of the few remaining Arrow Suspendeds left in the world (Why is it that there's only 1 Arrow Suspended left that I haven't ridden?). Anyways, after getting in the cars and pulling down the OTSRs, we're off. While we're climbing up the lifthill, we get a lovely view of the Great Wolf Lodge and the middle of nowhere Ohio. We then crest the lifthill. We turn around and just get a good view of Banshee and Drop Zone before we plunge down the first drop straight into the grass. We dive and gain a lot of speed. But before we know it, we're flung to the side as we slam into one of the high speed curves. At this point, all you can think is "THIS IS AWESOME!!!" But then we rise up into a sort of high turnaround. It still flings us around as we are high above the ground. But before you know it, you're back at the ground swinging back from side to side. And yup. Next up is a turnaround. This turnaround really makes the cars swing and the turn afterwards just makes us swing like a mad man. After more swinging, we sort of curve into a downward helix. You rush with speed as you head straight towards the pond. After some more swinging, we just swing into the brake run where we get the last bit of swinging out before we realize our ride is over. Bat is awesome!! Unfortunetly, Eagles Fortress closed down, so I'll never get to ride a suspended with orgasmic swinging. But I've currently been on 4 of the 5 existing suspended coasters and I doubt Vampire has that much swinging action, which would make Bat one of the best suspended coasters ever. I prefer Vortex at Canada's Wonderland to this due to the setting even though they're clones. I would TOTALLY recommend riding this if you're at Kings Island as it's not only one of the park's better coasters, but it's also one of the few remaining suspended coasters left.
