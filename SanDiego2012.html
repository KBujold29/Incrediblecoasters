All right. Its time for another fun Incrediblecoasters Trip. We decided to head on down to San Diego for many reasons. Mostly the fact that I hadn't been there in almost 5 years and Sea World San Diego got a new credit this year and I really wanted to head down there and try it out. And of course, we had to stop at Randys Doughnuts for breakfast.

Since we were making great time and had time to kill before Sea World opened, we decided to stop at Legoland to take some pictures.
</center>

<p>

<img src="manta.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This is why we're here.
</center>

<p>

<center>
All right. So just how was Manta?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manta3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, I must say that I'm impressed. I wasn't expecting much, but this ride delivered good airtime, good launches, good laterals, and a really good theme. Great job Sea World San Diego. Two thumbs up from Incrediblecoasters.

We decided to give Journey to Atlantis a courtesy ride because while its by far from the best water coaster ever, It's still a fun ride.
</center>

We had to check out Shipwreck Rapids. We just had to. Its too good of a water ride.
</center>

<p>

For once, the sign is actually telling the truth.

</center>
<center>
I remember riding this a long time ago when I went to Sea World when I was like 7. I just remember Allie got upset cause she got soaked and we had to go back to the hotel. And yeah. It gets you soaked.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
We decided to see the Blue Horizons Dolphin Show and while it wasn't a bad show, I felt it was too much Cirque Du Soleil and not enough dolphins.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
This stingray really liked us. He just wouldn't leave us alone. He just wanted us to keep petting him. I think he's a big fan of the site.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="stingray5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Check out this Stingray's demon eyes.

<img src="manta5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for us to marathon more Manta since it really is a good ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manta6.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I really love this ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manta7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't be fooled by its looks. There's actually some whip in this turn.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manta8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Overall, I must say that Manta is a really fun ride, a great family coaster, and a perfect addition to Sea World San Diego. Check out our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxqtfYAF2h8&list=UUaE-pwaJIYiDBmZev1SFtow&index=1&feature=plcp">raw footage video of the ride.</a>

<p>
<center>
<img src="belmontpark.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Thats enough Sea World San Diego for now. Time for us to hit up Belmont Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="belmontpark2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, Belmont Park doesn't seem nearly as good as when I was here <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/SanDiego2007.html">5 years ago.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="controlfreak.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
We just decided to take a quick ride on the Giant Dipper and head out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipper5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Its a really fun wooden coaster. The Santa Cruz Giant Dipper may be better, but I still really like it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipper6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Definetly give it a spin when in San Diego.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="beach6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And this concludes our visit to San Diego this year. Manta was fantastic, Sea World was much better than I remembered, Belmont Park wasn't nearly as good as I remembered, and I had a blast. I really hope to come back very soon.
