</center>
<center>
Sweet. This is a great view to wake up to.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="santaslodge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This however, is not a great hotel to stay at. Definetly not recommended by Incrediblecoasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="holidayworld2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. Today, we're at Holiday World.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wow. We already got a backstage tour. Today is looking great so far.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were able to get very close to the coasters today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Raven through the trees.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ooh!!! We're touching the Raven!!! We're so cool!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Enough looking around. Let's ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, I kind of found Raven to be overrated at first. (It got better in the evening.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="legend.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up, the Legend.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="legend2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While Raven and Voyage are better, I really found Legend to be a great woodie and it needs some more love.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of the Voyage.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Whoa Whoa Whoa!!! I like you as a friend and all, but that's it!!! Just a friend!!! Back Off!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So you know how most people think of the Voyage. But what about us?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This ride kicks ass. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I can't decide which I like more. Voyage or Coaster @ PNE Playland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And here are the Timberliners which I am looking foreword to seeing on Voyage in 2011.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="splashinsafari.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Let's check out Splashin Safari.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakuli.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, I never really got a chance to check out Splashin Safari. But oh well. It just gives me another reason to come back to this awesome park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soda4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yikes. It's boiling out here. How much are drinks here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soda5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
At Holiday World, your soft drink is FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is awesome. For once, I felt fully hydrated at a theme park. Thanks, you guys are awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildebeest.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, I at least managed to get on Wildebeest. So how was it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildebeest2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wildebeest was freaking amazing. It even replace Bombay Blasters as my new #1 Water Slide!!! Sorry Wild Rivers, but this day was gonna come sooner or later.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildebeest3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And it wouldn't have been possible to experience this awesome water slide without this awesome front of the line pass. Once again, thank you Holiday World. You guys are awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That may be it for Splashin Safari, but that certainly won't be it for getting wet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Pilgrims Plunge is a very interesting water ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Pilgrims Plunge is a giant shoot the chutes with an elevator lift and apparently, you don't get wet on it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So far, it looks like the rumors may be true.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. You do get wet. As expected from a giant shoot the chutes.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign144.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to check out a more patriotic part of Holiday World.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="libertylaunch.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
S&S Double Shots may be small, but man do they pack a punch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="howler.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right lets just get this over with.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="howler2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Credit Whores.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="howler3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey kids, now that you conquered Howler, you ready to go up against the Voyage?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In case you didn't know, this was lunch. We ate this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="holidog.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Holidog, what's up!! You wanna join the Incrediblecoasters Team?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bunnybread.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those are the ugliest bunnies I've ever seen in my life. And I know what ugly is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gobblergetaway.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Gobbler Getaway is Holiday World's Dark Ride. And it's a very interesting dark ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gobblergetaway2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"You're not shooting the turkeys. You're actually calling them. But don't tell PETA that."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gobblergetaway3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is that turkey doing what I think it's doing?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="turkeywhirl.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So that's what we were calling the turkeys for. We needed them to run the Tilt a Whirl for us. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone up for another ride on Pilgrim's Plunge?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That whole "You don't get wet" statement is total bullsh*t.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilgrimsplunge8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I can't wait till we drag Samantha on this thing later today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign145.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh boy. I finally got a job working at Holiday World.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. This is just the begenning of our amazing Backstage Tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello. I'm Samantha. Long time park employee, Tour Guide for your tour, and until the end of this tour, Pilgrims Plunge Virgin.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyways, on with the tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign146.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. Congratulations. From all at Incrediblecoasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First up, a park history lesson via puzzles.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In the 60s and 70s, we were known as Santa Claus Land and only had small flat rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In the 80s and 90s, They became Holiday World and added roller coasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture17.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And I'm not sure what this is since the Puzzle Man failed to finish this puzzle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Wow. I had no idea the Voyage Station was so big."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign147.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Who wrote that? We all know that a Holiday World employee wouldn't write Bad Butt on the whiteboard.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, time for a quick ride on the Voyage.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Random Voyage Car sitting randomly on a random peice of random ground randomly.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This ride is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
During the backstage tour, I was summoned to a Funnel Cake Challenge to see who can make a better funnel cake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dammit!! I dropped my wallet in the batter. Better go fish it out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's no coincidence that I was summoned to partake in this funnel cake challenge. For this is just training for my appearence on Iron Chef.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So far, so good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh my god. Did I just create that?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When I open up Incrediblecoastersland, all the funnel cakes served will look like this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ha! You're going down Kevin!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now this is how you make a funnel cake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap. That's a good looking funnel cake. Maybe if I put powdered sugar on mine, they won't notice the properness of Samantha's funnel cake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="funnelcakechallenge10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, I lost. Holiday World 1. Incrediblecoasters 0.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now back to our scheduled backstage tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soda6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What are the bottled drinks for when there's already free soda outside?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I guess to just go with this corn. =/
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign148.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up, the sign room.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's a good looking picture. They should build a mural to put that photo in like they have at SFMM. (And they need to update that BTW.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello, I have great ideas for Holiday World. I'd share them with you, but I'm not for obvious reasons.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, time for a Voyage Photo Walkback.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm still not sure what's better. Voyage or Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On one hand, These airtime hills are like Goliath's helix compared to the insanity of Coaster's airtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But Voyage feels a little crazier and lasts longer. It's close, but I'm still gonna go with Coaster as my #1 Woodie.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voyage14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Don't photograph me!!! I'm ashamed to have lost to a puny little wooden coaster in Canada!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raven5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for one last ride on Raven when it's running awesomely.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bingo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And one the bus to the hotel, we partook in Elissa Bingo.
