<center>
All right. Next up was Canobie Lake Park in New Hampshire, and man did this small little park kick a lot of ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
New for 2011 at Canobie Lake Park is a Gerstlauter Eurofighter called Untamed. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See. It really is called Untamed. I wasn't lying. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We ended up having an hour of morning ERT on Untamed, which was awesome!!! Oh, and the station is really nice as well. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"May I please join you in your morning Untamed ERT? I promise I won't maul anyone. Please?" =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And as expected, Untamed was totally awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was pretty much just like Spongebob, only without the airtime hill and the mid course brakes.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Although on a less pleasent note, some of our rides had a little bit of headbanging, which wasn't comfortable. But whatever. It's still a great ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yankeecannonball.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and in our hour of Untamed ERT, we also had Yankee Cannonball ERT. So it was an hour of ERT on the parks 2 best rides. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yankeecannonball2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Notice the empty seats, you tend to get those when you have a really good ERT session. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yankeecannonball3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!! Yankee Cannonball was great!! It was perfectly smooth and had some really nice pops of airtime!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rowdyrooster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Dammit!!! Who snapped the flyers!!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canobiecorkscrew.JPG" width="641" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hold on. There's still one last coaster left for us to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canobiecorkscrew2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not have been anything special, but at least it didn't try to kill us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonCANOBIE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Umm, you guys do realize that this is a powered coaster. It doesn't count."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonCANOBIE2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Yeah, we know. We're not trying to get any credits. We just enjoy being sad and pathetic." =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canobielake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In case you didn't know, Canobie Lake Park is located right on the shore of Canobie Lake. What? Did you seriously think that they just called it Canobie Lake Park just for sh*ts and giggles? Anyways, the setting of this park is beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="screamfest.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm, looks like Canobie Lake Park actually puts on a good Halloween Event.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bostonteaparty.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Do you get wet on this ride?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="turkishtwist.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Canobie Lake Park has a great flat ride collection containing many flat rides that other parks don't have anymore, like Rotors. *cough* Six Flags Magic Mountain *cough*
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waveblaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay!!! They have a bouncy bouncy ride here!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waveblaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But unfortunetly, our ride never bounced. We just spun around and ocassionally bounced. LAME!!!!! =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skeeball6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ever since Funtown Splashtown, I've become addicted to Skeeball!! I'm not joking!!! This is a serious problem!!! Get me into therapy so I can recover from this addiction!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcornstand.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Popcorn Stand #1 is a really good value."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sawmilllogflume.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to check out their log flume, since we've been riding them like crazy on this trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sawmilllogflume2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only did it have a great setting, but the log flume itself was pretty damn good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mineoflostsouls.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We also decided to check into the parks dark ride, the Mine of Lost Souls.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mineoflostsouls2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The story starts out with 2 kids getting lost in the Mine of Lost Souls and we need to find them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mineoflostsouls3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride made my brain hurt. How did we end up in a mine in New Hampshire to an Ancient Mummy Tomb in Egypt? =/
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="airhockey.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Quit your smiling Jason!!! Air Hockey is a very serious sport!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"This burger from Burger Bar #3 is nothing special."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crazycups.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may look like an ordinary teacup ride, but it's not. It goes in a figure 8 shape. It sounds confusing in words, so just go to Canobie Lake Park and check it out for yourselves.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="starblaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What sort of ride is called Starblaster?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="starblaster2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, it's an S&S Double Shot. And those are always fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="starblaster3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the ride was fun and all, I just want to cliff jump from that. Seriously, this ride is of cliff jumping size. Just look at it and compare it to <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/50ftjump.jpg">the 50 fter</a> at Tar Creek and compare size. Seem the same to me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to take a couple more rides on Untamed since it's a really good ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="untamed9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is a great edition to Canobie Lake Park and totally fits in with the park. Smart move Canobie Lake Park. Smart move.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tikimaze.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How many parks do you know have a mirror maze?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tikimaze2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap. You can't crash in this maze. I'm screwed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tikimaze3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey look!!! It's that evil kid!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremefrisbee.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
LAME!!!!!!! =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfsupCANOBIE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh great. Another ride called Surfs Up. Let's hope that it TOO doesn't break on us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfsupCANOBIE2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only did it not break on us, but it ran a good program. Win Win situation for us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yankeecannonball4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to end our day at Canobie Lake Park with a ride on Yankee Cannonball.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yankeecannonball5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is definetly one of the more underrated rides in the roller coaster community.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="parkmap.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What do you mean it's not normal to take all of the parks park maps?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mountain2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Canobie Lake Park was awesome. Now it's time for us to take the long drive to Canada.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lake3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
New Hampshire is f*cking beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="walgreens.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We had to go to Walgreens to get an air freshener since SOMEONE stunk up the back of the bus.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgerking.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I didn't know that Burger King served smoothies.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgerking2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! This is the best Burger King ever!!! Not only do they have a Freestyle Coke Machine, but they had an ENTIRE different menu than in California. Sure, they still had Whoppers and the usual stuff, but they had all sorts of stuff that I never saw in CA Burger King.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgerking3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I tried more Freestyle Coke Creations here than I did in all my SFMM visits put together.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bordercrossing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh crap!!! Border Crossing!!! Everyone act natural!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we made past Border Patrol and got to our hotel in Montreal. The only thing is that when we got to our hotel, we had no power. Yep. Our hotel had no electricty. So yeah. I couldn't charge my cameras and none of the lights in the hotel worked, which really made finding our rooms to be a challenge. This is pretty much what it looked like going through the halls of the hotel. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When we reached our room, we opened the door, and we couldn't see a thing. We had no idea what our room looked like so I snapped this picture and Antonio and I first saw what our room looked like solely through this picture on my camera. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stormdamage.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In case you're wondering why we had no power, it turns out that a storm a couple days totally wrecked through Montreal and knocked down that power line that brought the hotel electricity.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stormdamage2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This storm was pretty damn bad. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Normally, a lack of power would've totally screwed us over, but luckily tonight was the Alcohol Exchange, so we were too busy drinking and having fun outside to care about electricity.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And I was actually able to take part in this fun since Canada actually is smart and has an 18/19 drinking age depending on the province. I'm not going to get into my rant about how f*cking stupid the U.S 21 Drinking Age is because if I did, it'd have more text than the rest of the entire Northeast Trip Update. Let's just say that I turned my drinking age rant into a 6.5 page college essay and got an A.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I have no idea what you're mixing into that drink, but I want it."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh man. I'm gonna be pissing blood tomorrow. But it'll totally be worth it."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This dutch alcohol beverage was intersting. It had an herbal taste to it, almost like a tea, and it was 30 % alcohol.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hmm. This alcoholic drink seems very strange. It's bland, jagged, and making my mouth bleed. I better not drink this. It doesn't seem vegan."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tomorrow morning is going to be very intersting for a lot of you guys.
