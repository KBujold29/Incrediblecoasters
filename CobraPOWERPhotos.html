We're here at Power Park to ride your typical Boomerang. Well, almost typical Boomerang. Power Park wanted a Boomerang. But they wanted to make it as special and good as possible. So they got these really cool open trains and magnetic brakes. Both which really make the ride much better. Seriously, more Vekomas need open trains like that. After climbing in the seat and pulling down the shoulder harness, you dispatch. Up the lift you go backwards. You get a pretty view of the park while going up the lift hill. And then, you drop. The drop is really fun and you get some nice speed. However, once you pull up into the sky as you enter the cobra roll, you brace yourself for the pain, but it's not there. It's actually a lot of fun. Those trains really work (and Power Park has really good maintanence). After you navigate your way through the cobra roll with no headbanging, you go into a loop. The loop is fun and it pulls quite alot of Gs. Then you climb up the second spike, as we climb up the second spike, you get a chance to recover, but then, you drop. Backwards you go. The loop is quite weird backwards. And then you go backwards into the cobra roll. You brace for pain, but it's not there. And finally, it is over, You glide into the station. And this is by far the weirdest part of the ride. Unlike on most Boomerangs, you don't just glide to a stop. You just sort of stop. It's really weird. I'm not sure what it is about those magnetic brakes. You just stop. It's this sudden, yet perfectly smooth stop. Something about it just doesn't feel natural. I know I'm going to sound nuts for saying this, but the stop almost made me feel nauseous. I have no idea why! It's just magnetic brakes. Whatever. This is still by far, the best Boomerang as this one is really smooth and fun. Not to mention, I like that stop. I never thought I'd say this about a Boomerang, but I'd recommend riding it.
