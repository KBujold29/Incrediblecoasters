All right. Christmas Time and New Years is now over. But during that time period, I managed to take two visits to Six Flags Magic Mountain, two visits to the Disneyland Resort, and two visits to Knotts Berry Farm. And once again, rather than just having many smaller updates, I figured it'd just be best to have one mega update for this time of year. Because nothing says letting go of the Christmas Season and New Years than by posting a bunch of pictures from that time era!!! =) (Seriously though, Christmas stuff in Janurary is a big pet peeve of mine.) Anyways, we first started out this update by getting Allie, and her friend Jenna, on Green Lantern for the first time, which was quite funny.

This was not a good day to go to In'N'Out. It was packed, and I don't want to say the food was bad today, but I could definetly feel it afterwords.

While it was running really fast today, it was also really rough with a lot of chestbanging.

Hmm. Should I ride Orient Express or Orient Express. The decision is so tough.
