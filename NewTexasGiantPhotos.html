Today at Incrediblecoasters, we're going to be reviewing New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas. Now this is a Rocky Mountain Makeover, where they take an old busted sh*tty wooden coaster and turn it into a kickass crazy steel coaster. And considering that the old Texas Giant looked INCREDIBLY similar to <a href="MeanStreakPhotos.html">Mean Streak</a> (which was a TERRIBLE ride. So glad they tore it down and also gave it the RMC treatment), so the fact that this coaster got a makeover is GREAT!!! And this is a fun fact. New Texas Giant was the first RMC that was ever built. This was the coaster that began the boom of RMC coasters, all of which are AMAZING rides and wouldn't exist if it wasn't for New Texas Giant. So in a way, this is a historic coaster and is pretty much the <a href="BatmantheRideSFGAmPhotos.html">Batman the Ride (SFGAm)</a> of the 2010s. This is a coaster that is going to go down in history like <a href="CorkscrewSWPhotos.html">Corkscrew @ Knotts</a> and <a href="MagnumXL200Photos.html">Magnum XL 200</a>. So this is not only an awesome ride, but a historical ride as well. So let's not waste any more time and ride this ride. After operations that were WAY too long, we get in the Gerslauter trains, pull down the lap bar, buckle the pointless seatbelt, and we're off. Now I do actually prefer the Gerstlauter trains. But because the operators at Six Flags Over Texas are idiots that can't tell if people are too fat to ride and managed to kill someone the day after I visit because of that, no rides have trains like that anymore. But whatever. Minor nitpick. We're off!! YAY!!! =) We roll around a turn and begin climbing the lifthill. To our left, there's not much of a view, but to our right, we get a nice view of the park. But hey. We crest the lifthill, and we head down the first drop. And it's a really good fist drop. We head down a first drop It not only gives us quite a lot of speed, but there's some good airtime here too. We then head up a small hill. It's not puny, but still fairly small. Just the right size for a big pop of EJECTOR airtime. Nice. =) We then head up this sort of 90 degree banked turn. It's got a couple laterals and is just an overall, really fun element. We then head up through another 90 degree banked curved hill. It's got a couple more laterals and it's just a ton of fun. I love it. I really love it. And hey, coming out of this, we just drop down and get another pop of airtime. Wee!!! =) We then of course, head through another one of those 90 degree banked curved hills. More laterals and more fun. We then head through a small little hill, get a nice little bump of airtime before heading up a curved hill, which leads us straight into the midcourse brakes. Hey. I'm enjoying the ride so far. Let's hope that it continues to be good. We then head down a curved drop to the ground, which gives us more speed and just is a lot of fun. We then head up into an airtime hill. But sadly, there's no airtime right here. At least none that I felt. We head through a couple little dips as well as through an S Curve, weird, kind of awkward, but fun, and we drop back down to the ground again. Wee!!! =) We then head through a banked airtime hill, which gives us a little bit of airtime as well as some laterals. It's not as crazy as you'd think it'd be, but it's still a lot of fun. We then head around a curve and into another airtime hill. It's not that crazy, but it's a lot of fun. We then head through a sort of bouncy airtime hill with some laterals. Wee. That's even more fun. We then head into a small little airtime hill as we TAKE THE TUNNEL!!! Now originally, this tunnel had cool flashing lights. But they certainly weren't on when I was there (SMH. Typical Six Flags Maintenence). And hey, we curve out of that tunnel and back into the light. And BAM!!! TAKE ANOTHER TUNNEL!!! The bad news is that the lights weren't working again (Damn it. Stupid Six Flags Over Texas). But there's another airtime hill here. And there's a nice little pop inside. Wee!! =) We then head around a turn, and TAKE YET ANOTHER TUNNEL!!! There's no lights inside, but to be fair to Six Flags Over Texas, there were never lights inside. And there's another airtime hill. Wee!! =) We pop out into the daylight. Go through another airtime hill. Wee!! =) Then we rise up and glide straight into the brake run. I will admit that New Texas Giant is a very fun ride and it has a lot of fun airtime as well as some fun laterals. However, the reputation for this ride is INSANE!!! People LOVE this ride. And I mean more than all the other RMCs. The airtime on this coaster gets compared to that of <a href="ElToroPhotos.html">El Toro</a>. I'm sorry, but no. It's got some fun pops of airtime, but this is not the crazy ejector air that is found on coasters like El Toro. El Toro is MUCH better than this coaster. So in a way, I do consider New Texas Giant to be overrated as while I still really enjoyed it, it wasn't as good as I was hoping it would be and it is towards the bottom of my RMC rankings (Only <a href="JokerPhotos.html">Joker</a> is lower). Now to be fair, I only rode New Texas Giant once thanks to terrible operations and it had been closed for a while before I got on it, so it wasn't warmed up completely (Again, thank you for such lovely operations Six Flags Over Texas). So I'm hoping that I just got a weak ride on it and that it's much crazier when I go back for rerides. But even if not so, it's still a very fun coaster that I really enjoyed and would love to ride again. So yeah. I totally recommend riding New Texas Giant when visiting Six Flags Over Texas. It's a lot of fun. =)
