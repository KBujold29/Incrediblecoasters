For today's review, we are off to some American Fair to review Olympic Bobsled. Now for most people, this looked like nothing special. Just a standard Galaxy. Just get the damn credit and lets do something else. So you hopped in the cars, pull down the lap bar, buckle your seatbelt, watch out for the awkward annoying arm-guard (Seriously, this thing is not pleasant) and we're off!!! You slowly roll around a turn. Though you do get a nice view of the fairgrounds and Olympic Bobsled before you begin to climb the lifthill. After you climb up the lifthill, you go through another slow turn, getting a great view of the fairgrounds. Then you head down the first drop. In the front, its just a fun first drop, but in the back, we got a very special surprise. AIRTIME!!! Galaxies never have airtime, but we got a little in the back seat. We then rise up a hill before we roll through another turn. We get a great view of the parking lot (Riveting) before we drop back down another drop. We gain some more speed and go right under the first drop, which actually gave us a nice headchopper effect before we rise up a small hill where shockingly enough, we get some really good airtime. Seriously, why aren't other Galaxies this good? The one at <a href="OfficialPalacePlaylandPage.html">Palace Playland</a> was a peice of sh*t, but this is fun. Then we go through a double helix. There's nothing particuarly exciting about this part of the ride. It doesn't gain much speed or have many laterals, but it's still fun. We then rise up a small little hill, but unfortunetly, theres a nasty trim here. LAME!!!!!!! We go through a small dip before rolling through another double helix. Wee. After gaining some speed from the double helix, we go through a slight turn, go through a dip, and go around a turn and get some laterals before rolling into the final brakes. While not one of the best rides ever, it's still a really fun ride and one of the better Galaxies. As long as you can ignore the arm guard that might as well be a f*cking fence.
