  <img src="hotelcolloseo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. After our fun evening at Holiday Park, we were off to stay at Europa Park's on site hotel, the Hotel Colloseo.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodanmodel.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Nice Wodan Model you got there. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelcolloseo2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well lets go to our rooms and put our stuff away.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelcolloseo3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn. These rooms are NICE!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelcolloseo4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You may have thought that we just went to bed, but nope. We hit the bar for some fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelcolloseo5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Neil decided to buy me a fancy drink. So I got a Sex on the Beach, but spilled about 75% of it on the floor like the clumsy idiot I am.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="breakfast2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good morning. The Hotel Colloseum really had a good breakfast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to head on over to Europa Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We'll be taking the secret hotel entrance to the park today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture29.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When you see the bull's balls, you know you're in the right place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First off, we start off our morning with Blue Fire ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, it wasn't technically ERT as it was open to other hotel guests as well. Which I normally wouldn't mind, except that some asshole kid from the hotel stole Will's camera.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpenexpress.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After our Blue Fire ERT, we decided to check out the rest of the park. And while we're here. Why the hell not ride the powered coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpenexpress2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not count as a credit, but it was a lot of fun. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bibliothekdebrothersgrimm.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not knowing what the hell it was, we decided to try out the Bibliothek der Brothers Grimm.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bibliothekdebrothersgrimm2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, yeah. This was probably the most f*cked up thing I have ever seen in a theme park. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bibliothekdebrothersgrimm3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I really love this new look. I must say, this is my favorite ride ever. I think I love it even more than beer."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bibliothekdebrothersgrimm4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Apparently, they put us in the show and I was the wizard and they had to find me. Ummm, Hooray?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, I just have to stop and walk around to really absorb all of the beauty Europa Park has to offer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is so well themed that its pracically unbelieveable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Afterwards, we decided to go and check out Euro Mir.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is so bizzare, strange, and f*cked up, that its just unbelievable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets check out their Bobsled.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. The Mack Bobsleds are much better than the Intamin ones.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhornblitz.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its time to check out the parks Wild Mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhornblitzline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this park hauls ass with operations. They're so good that even their Wild Mouse has good operations. And it has cool barnyard theming in line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhornblitz2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aren't these your favorite rides ever Cliff?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhornblitz3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. There's a tilting elevator lift on this ride!!! AWESOME!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="matterhornblitz4.JPG" width="640" height="512" />
</center>
<center>
But yeah. After the elevator, its pretty much just the typical Big First Drop Wild Mouse. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="posideonline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, its gonna get a long line, so lets get Posideon out of the way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="posideon.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But yeah. Thanks to Europa Park's incredible operations, what would normally be a 2 hour line was only 30 minutes. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="posideon2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. Its a really cool water coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Attention aileans. You are welcome at Europa Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, did I go back to Switzerland?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raclette.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Elissa kept raving about how good the raclette is here, so yeah. I naturally went and tried it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raclette2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. Raclette is some really freaking good cheese!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vindjammer.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! Windjammer is still alive!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vindjammer2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. First off, its Vindjammer, and its just a pirate ship.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets check out the parks new for 2012 GCI, Wodan. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodanline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Its got a long line, but luckily, we're in Europa Park. This won't be very long. Plus its well themed too.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign240.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In this mythical place a long time ago, they drank this magical substance called Coca Cola.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That first drop looks freaking amazing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Mmm. Wodan tastes good. Now I need a beer to wash it down."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This looks freaking amazing. Could this be my new favorite GCI?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. It was fun and all, but its not my favorite or even my 2nd favorite. The first drop is amazing, but after that, it mostly felt like Terminator. Yeah, its a really fun ride, but not quite as good as I was expecting.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="atlanticasupersplash.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I did not bother with Atlantica Supersplash. Now some of you may be baffled since I'm a total credit whore, and I am. The only problem is that its not a credit, and I'd rather spend my time at Europa Park doing much better stuff.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets take a ride on their Monorail and just take a nice good look at this amazing park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="foodloop.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I didn't eat here, but they did have a cool resteraunt that had your food ride a roller coaster to your table. Which is totally awesome. I'd like to try the place out next time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sleighridesnowflake.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! A random dark ride with no line!!! Lets take a ride!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sleighridesnowflake2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a fun ride, though it felt weird riding a winter themed dark ride in the middle of summer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pegasusEUROPA.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets just focus on getting the rest of the credits at Europa Park. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pegasusEUROPA2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We'll get this one out of the way since it seems like a  small coaster with not so great (by Europa Park standards) capacity.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pegasusEUROPA3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this was a really fun ride. It was definetly bigger than a kiddy coaster, but not quite a big coaster. It felt like a giant roller skater on steroids and is a perfect family coaster. I'm glad that there are clones of this thing at other parks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eurosat.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I must be hallucinating. For I seem to have morphed Europa Park into Epcot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eurosat2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. They just host Euro Sat inside the same type of building that they have Spaceship Earth in.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eurosat3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!! Euro Sat has its very own escelator!!! How fancy!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverstar.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. All we need now is Silver Star and we're done. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, yeah. The line for Silver Star is very strange.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverstar2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
AKA, you're gonna be waiting forever for the front row.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverstar3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So yeah. How did Silver Star rank up to the other B&M Hypers?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverstar4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honsetly, I wasn't that impressed. It totally reminded me of Goliath @ La Ronde. It was fun, but certainly not very strong.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cheers to getting all the credits in Europa Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now we can relax and just take it easy at Europa Park. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eurotower.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Lets go up in the Observation Tower and get some great ariel (video) shots.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="elfboatride.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, lets go check out the Stupid Boat Ride!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign241.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I've got so much to live for!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="elfboatride2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its a good thing you're in a place like Europa Park and not in a place like SFMM or else you'd be dead long ago.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="puppetboatride.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we liked the last stupid boat ride. So lets go ride another one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="puppetboatride2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Does this thing spin or is the beer just kicking in?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="puppetboatride3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! Its themed to Pinnochio!!!! Now when do we turn into...oh wait, we turned into jackasses long ago.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantslidelabyrinth.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Why the hell not?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantslidelabyrinth2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Dammit. It looks like I'm finally paying for my lifesyle of living off nothing but Beer and Dunar Kebabs."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantslidelabyrinth3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, these slides are actually really freaking insane. You completely fly off them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="geisterschosis.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another cool Europa Park Dark Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="geisterschosis2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its this sort of weird haunted mansion type knock off. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="geisterschosis3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Its a kick ass dark ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lets take another ride on Schwiezer Bobbahn. Their bobsled.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. You can see the way it twists through all the turns.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Look out for that tiny little river.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Quick. Gotta finish my beer before I hop on the bobsled.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I see I've still got my chugging skills from my college days down."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahn7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
May I ask whats going on in the front row?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gyro.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I decided to try out the Gyros here, since they're similar to Duner Kebabs. Damn, these things kick some major ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm, more Blue Fire? I like that. I like that a lot. And yeah, Blue Fire is awesome. The launch is good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This funky turn is so slow it feels like you're going to roll back at the top.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The loop is nothing special, but it is awesome since you're going through it all with just a lap bar.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefire6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And then we have the final inline twist (Not the one in the picture). HOLY CRAP!!! THIS PART IS INSANE!!!! Its seriously one of the best inversions on any ride with a GREAT whip. It almost feels like Ispeed for this part.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey!!! It looks like Europa Park decided to rescue Jaws and save him from the death that awaited him at Universal Studios Florida.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm sure you can handle another Europa Park beauty photo. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
GROUP TAKEOVER OF EURO MIR!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELL F*CKING YES!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is insane. First, you go up this huge spiral lifthill in the dark while its amazing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqQEVxMqWds">theme song</a>.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Then you go through a ton of fun with the mirrors on the towers at the top.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="euromir7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And the main roller coaster part is pretty crazy too with some fun drops, and actually some insane laterals at the end, especially when riding backwards.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="europapark11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Keep holding on!!!! You'll eventually make it back up!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After that fun Euro Mir Party, the park announced that we would be getting ERT on Wodan!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wodan7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It was a great 30 minutes with lots of rides in on Wodan.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm in Europe all right.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And after Wodan ERT, we went to the hotel where we had a great dinner.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="entertainer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Dammit. Of all the days to leave our unicycles at home..."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelcolloseo6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Checking out the hotel seeing all they have to offer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="model6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey guys, look really closely at this photo!!! Look what I got!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="feild7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Why no, officers. We're John Deere Enthusiasts. That's all." (If you weren't there, you don't get this joke). =)
</center>

Surprisingly, the very front of the park was not gated off or anything, so we went in and checked out the Adventure Playground, and yes. That slide is also crazy.

Euro Sat is very interesting. Imagine Space Mountain, if it had a long snake train, had a spiral lifthill, was super fast and twisted everywhere, provided lots of laterals, and blasted techno music.
