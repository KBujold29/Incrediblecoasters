We're here at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. Today's ride we'll be reviewing for you is Roadrunner Express. This is the parks mine train, and I've got some good news for you. This is definetly one of the better mine trains out there. Yeah, it's not as good as any of the <a href="BigThunderMtnDLPPhotos.html">Big Thunder Mountains</a> or <a href="ThunderationPhotos.html">Thunderation</a> or <a href="ColoradoAdventurePhotos.html">Colorado Adventure (AKA, the Michael Jackson Thrill Ride)</a>. But honestly, aside from those, this would be my favorite Mine Train. So that would make Roadrunner Express my 6th favorite Mine Train. AWESOME!!! WE'RE #6!!! =) Which doesn't really mean much, but screw it. I like this ride. Let's get in the cars, pull down the lap bars, and away we go. We roll around a turn and begin to climb up the lifthill. It's not very big, but thanks to it's location, you get a great view of both Iron Rattler, as well as of the quarry. We head down a small dip, around a turn and down the first drop, dipping down to the ground, and underneath Iron Rattler. All right. We got some speed now. We then head up a big swooping hill that's a lot of fun. We then turn and head up another small curved hill. Hmm. There haven't been any brakes or lifthills yet. Wow, this really is a special mine train. =) We then head around another turn and...F*CK!!! Lifthill. I take back what I said about this ride being special. =( Even so, it's still one of the better mine trains. We then head down some straight track up on top of the quarry and around a turn. Now at this point, you used to be able to see Wile E Coyote try and push a boulder on top of the riders. But sadly, that peice of theming has since been removed. WHAT THE HELL SIX FLAGS!!? IT'S A PEICE OF PLASTIC!!! THERE'S NOTHING TO MAINTAIN!!! F*CKING LAME!!! We then head down a helix drop, not to the ground, but we do gain a bit of speed. We then curve up a little bit and lose that speed. We then head around some curves, head into a a shed, and hit the brake run. So yeah. You can see that while I'm still fairly pissed at the fact that Six Flags took out the theming that isn't hard to maintain, they still have one of the better mine trains out there. It's just a really fun layout that actually has some good speed to it. I'd definetly give it a ride if you're at Six Flags Fiesta Texas. Especially if you're a mine train junky.
