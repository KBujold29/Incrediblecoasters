    <font color="#33FF00">
    All right. Time for our major trip of 2021. We're visiting all sorts of parks all over the East Coast and Midwest, and the trip starts at Lake Compounce. A fun park that hosts one of the best wooden coasters in the country. But on top of that, check out their new coaster (it was sadly closed, along with a lot of other rides), as well as their Bites'N'Pints Food Festival.</p></td>

    Sorry for this update being so late. Long story on why included inside. But last year, right before California allowed theme parks to reopen for COVID, Knotts wanted to do a Boysenberry Festival since it was that time. However, they couldn't do that thanks to regulations at the time. So they did the Taste of Boysenberry Festival. Check out all these delicous foods and more in this tasty update.</p></td>

    All right. We're down to the last one. Yep, we're reviewing the final Cedar Fair park that needs to be reviewed, as well as our last park review until we visit new theme parks to review. Kings Dominion. This place has a pretty good repuation for coaster enthusiasts. I mean, this place has Intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers. Some of the best coasters in America. But what about the rest of the park? What else does Kings Dominion have to offer? Check out our review and find out.</p></td>

    Busch Gardens Williamsburg frequently gets toted as one of the best theme parks in America. And visiting the park, it's pretty easy to see why. This place has really great roller coasters, great theming, cool shows, animals, and is just an all around great park. Check out our review of this amazing theme park.</p></td>

    So....as you all know, 2020 was a dumpster fire of a year, and has been declared by nearly everyone, the worst year ever. A pandemic ravaged the world (let alone the other issues with the year). And...the world came to an end, including the theme park world. So...here's an update showcasing our coaster season in Winter before everything closed, as well as showing off what little fun California allowed. Check out some roller coasters, some silly fun, and food! There's a lot of food in this update!</p></td>

    <font size="4">
    <font color="#33FF00">
    All right. Now Six Flags America doesn't have the best reputation amongst coaster enthusiasts. Bad operations among other issues have frequently been cited against this park when judging it. But just how true is all that? Is Six Flags America as bad as the other coaster enthusiasts will have you believe? Well, check out review to see how the park is as well as their coasters.</p></td>

    All right. All of the theme parks in California are still closed thanks to COVID-19 (Despite other parks showing them how they can operate safely). However, the coaster withdrawls were too strong, so we went to Lagoon in Utah, since....that's not only the closest major amusement park that's open to us, but it's also one of our favorite independent parks in the US. Check out all the awesome rides from this park, see how Lagoon does their Halloween Event, see what precautions they're taking because of the pandemic, and even check out an Alpine Coaster in the Mountains as well.</p></td>

    Now I'm sad to report this, but Toshimaen closed down at the end of August. Not because of COVID-19, but rather, because Tokyo wants to build a big Harry Potter museum on the property. *Sigh* At least this victim isn't nearly as good as its other victims. But anyways, Toshimaen was a fun little park. Nothing special. Fairly generic. But I had fun here. Check out this review in memory of this fun little Japanese park.</p></td>

    Yokohama Cosmoworld is a park that may not have too much. All of the coasters here are pretty much credit whoring, even if one of the coasters is famous and well known. It's bark is better than its bite. But it's still a fun little park to spend some time. Check it out, and explore the park as you look around Yokohama.</p></td>

The theming there is so good! Amazing dark rides! Amazing theming! Amazing food! There is so much! So many classics along with lots of custom and unique things.
