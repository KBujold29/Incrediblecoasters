    All right. We've got another new park review. Now Casino Pier may not be anything truly special. The one thing this park got famous for was all the viral damage it recieved during Hurricane Sandy in 2012 with Star Jet collapsing into the ocean. But how is it as just an ordinary Seaside Park? Check that out as we go over the park itself and its fun and intersting coasters.</p></td>

    All right. After years of hiatus, we're finally back at the Disneyland Resort. And oh boy, they've added QUITE A LOT for us to catch up on. Check out all the changes that Disneyland has made and listen to us praise the ones that are good (Galaxy's Edge and Avengers Campus), complain about the ones that are bad (Pixar Pier and the decision to retire a certain classic, giant rant on that in this update), as well as check out all the other classics that are beloved in the Disneyland Resort. </p></td>

    <font size="4">
    <font color="#33FF00">
    All right. We're out reviewing one of the newest parks to open in America, Nickelodeon Universe at the American Dream Mall. This is a really rare treat as brand new parks RARELY open up in America in this day and age, and this place has a lot of cool rides, including a kickass Eurofighter and some crazy contraption from Intamin. But it's also garnered a lot of criticism since its opening. Is it justified or is this a cool new kickass place ready for a long life ahead of it? The answer will be revealed in this review of not only Nickelodeon Universe, but also the American Dream Mall as a whole.</p></td>

    All right. Time for our one out-of-state trip of 2022, which wound up being a road trip out to New Mexico, where we FINALLY tackle a theme park we were screwed out of 9 years ago. Check out all of this fun at Cliffs, along with other fun. Check out Cliffs, as well as Wacky Alien Sh*t in Roswell, some cool nature, a nice water park in Arizona, and other fun moments in this road trip.</p></td>

    So Six Flags Magic Mountain opened up a new coaster last year (sorry the update is so damn late), and...new coaster at our home park? We have to check it out! ESPECIALLY when its a major RMC, which...yeah. It kicks ass (So much better than Jersey Devil), Check out Wonder Woman: Flight of Courage, as well as the other fun coasters at Six Flags Magic Mountain, as well as some of the cool water parks at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor as well.</p></td>

    We're finally at the end. The East Coast Trip has finally come to an end, and it ends with us at one of the most popular parks with coasters enthusiasts, Knoebels (we finally got a full day here). Check out some of the best wooden coasters in America, crazy flat rides, good food, and even some bonus credit whoring at Dutch Wonderland, as well as some more bonus fun and culture in New York City as well.</p></td>

    Now here's a park I haven't visited in a very long time. We're back at Hersheypark, one of the biggest parks in the Northeast. And there's quite a lot of new stuff for us. Check out several new for us coasters including one of the best coasters in the country, a new B&M Hyper, a lot of candy, and so much more fun to be found in this update.</p></td>

    Time to hit up two new parks. They may be smaller parks, but we had a ton of fun at both of them. Check out some cool and kooky coasters, including the oldest roller coaster in the world that predates air travel. Also, there's some creepy storybook characters, intense games of Mini-Golf, and other fun to be had in this update.</p></td>
