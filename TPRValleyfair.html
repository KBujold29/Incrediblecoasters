  <img src="wildthing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. It's our last park of the TPR Middle America Trip. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="valleyfair.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But luckily, we ended at a pretty kickass park known as Valleyfair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In typical TPR Tradition, we have started the day with ERT on Wild Thing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. This is how ERT should be.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wild Thing ERT Craziness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was pretty much just like Mamba and Steel Force. Yeah, all Morgan Hypers are pretty much. Now I've completed the standard Morgan Hyper Collection. (Ok, I still need Steel Dragon in Japan, but I'm unfortunetly not going to make it to Japan anytime soon, so it'll just stay with the American Trio for a while.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="highroller.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, Wild Thing ERT is over. Time to go and get the credits. First up, High Roller. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="highroller2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
High Roller was a very bizzare ride. It felt like it had potential to be decent, but was raped by a set of super harsh trims on the first turnaround.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="madmouseVF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Up next, Mad Mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="madmouseVF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the ride itself was decent, A very special moment has occured on the Arrow Wild Mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="madmouseVF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ash got his #100th Credit!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="madmouseVF4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey, at least my 100th wasn't a Boomerang."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="loopingstarship.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OMFG!!! Who's idea was it to ride this and why the hell did I join them!!!? I've said it before and I'll say it again. These rides are the product of the Devil herself.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to take a day ride on Renegade in case it blew up and Night ERT got cancelled.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Renegade is still a very good woodie and definetly my 2nd Favortite GCI after Prowler.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="excalibur.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now it's time to take a ride on Excalibur, AKA "Frankenstein the ride."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="excalibur2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"IT'S ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="excalibur3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Seriously though, Excalibur was a very bizzare and f*cked up coaster. I don't even know if I consider it to be a good coaster or a bad coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As for good coasters, it's time for us to head to Steel Venom.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup, it was another really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But unlike V2 @ SFGAm, the holding brake was actually working on Steel Venom. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Steel Venom Twistiness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Check me out. I got my 100th credit today. Arn't I special?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chaosVF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, they still have their Chaos here at Valleyfair. This place just got even awesomer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wild Thing VS Steel Venom. FIGHT!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to get the final credit needed here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Credit #220.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To my suprise, this was actually a really smooth Arrow Corkscrew.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Verical Loop on the Corkscrew.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. This looks quite similar to another park I've been to.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewVF6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yet another fake helix of death.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powertower.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now that we got all the credits out of the way, we can relax and enjoy the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign161.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But first, lunch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="band.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This band was actually pretty good and managed to play some hits such as Smooth Criminal, and of course, Renegade.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Valleyfair actually decided to do something different and serve us a Tex Mesh rather than typical burgers and stuff. It was really good, I just wish it wasn't so windy since it blew my plate around. (Luckily, all the food was off.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pointlessawards.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And then we had the Pointless Awards Ceremony.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. And as a suprise, Valleyfair gave us on ride photo magnests of us on Wild Thing during our morning ERT. First off, thank you Valleyfair. You guys are awesome. Second off, why do Laura and I look like we're getting tazered in our onride photo?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now onto our Backstage Tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wheels.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wheels. It had to be wheels.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wheels2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I knew we've only been together for a few minutes, but will you marry me?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="domo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Who let Domo in here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wild Thing from the backstage tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign162.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, because the last thing the United States needs is yet another pointless war.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, get ready to see a bunch of cool kickass backstage Renegade shots.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's the common backstage shot. It's a common shot and appears on Valleyfair brochures and on their website. But you can't get it unless you're on a backstage tour. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, this isn't a shot you see very often.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="board.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Check me out and my badass wood. Oh come on, my wood is too badass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Mike, that's badass wood right there. What you were holding in your hands there is nothing but crap.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Another cool first drop angle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, there's actually airtime right there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Renegade Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="camera9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ha Ha! Look at those losers on the other side of the gate. Must take photo of losers."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="train2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, I was not hit by the train and you're a sick individual for hoping I was.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeswing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I decided to go and check out their Screaming Swing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeswing2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, that was awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeswing3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Xtreme Swing from the earlier backstage tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tilter.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We made a deal and promised that Neil would ride the Tilt a Whirl if Jackie would then ride the rapids. Thankfully, they both agreed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tilter2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, I don't even care if Jackie does the rapids. Neil on the Tilt a Whirl was the funniest thing on Incrediblecoasters since seeing Robin on the Sun Wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mildthing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
People in our group wanted to get their Mild Thing credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mildthing2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
However, it was another children only kiddie coaster where you could only get the credit if you went to Valleyfair as a child.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mildthing3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Neil and Colin thought that a little green would be able to get past this obstacle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mildthing4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Sorry, we only take bribes with American Dollars. I have no idea what the hell a pound is and I hope I never find out."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skittles.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, these things are awesome. I've always thought to myself "The only way they could improve Skittles was if they carbonated them." People called me crazy, but now my wet skittles dream has come true.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="love2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I can not hide my feelings anymore. I love you Brian.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thundercanyon.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it was cool to see Jackie on the rapids, I'd much rather see Neil on the Tilt a Whirl again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="valleyfairmap.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Valleyfair will be getting a Planet Snoopy in 2011.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waveVF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, that's not bad photoshop. That's just a bad picture of the Wave @ Valleyfair which produces a huge splash.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
At this point, I decided to just head into the parking lot get parking lot shots until the bus comes to take us to dinner. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Artsy Shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I keep expecting the train to come and hit me in this shot due to Mamba's Headchopper Helix.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Steel Venom Parking Lot Shots.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom7.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I really like this shot. There's just something about it that I really like.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom8.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That holding brake is definetly awesome.
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelvenom9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Umm, Samantha? Is everything all right? I mean, it's only an Impulse Coaster. It can't be that bad."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wild Thing Shadow Shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="valleyfair2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good bye Valleyfair. See you later tonight for Renegade ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buffalowildwings.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In the mean time, it's time for dinner at Buffalo Wild Wings.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buffalowildwings2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cheers, to a kick ass trip and a kick ass finale of kick ass Renegade.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buffalowildwings3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like Martin is winning in Trivia again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buffalowildwings4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Michael's going for the Buffalo Wild Wings Challenge. Can he do it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buffalowildwings5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup, he did it. And while he looks like the Joker here, he still has more balls than I ever will for doing it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Night falls and we head back to Valleyfair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildthing13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One last Wild Thing ride at night before it happens.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
RENEGADE ERT!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="renegade11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Renegade ERT kicked major ass. It was simply f*cking amazing. There was screaming, cheering, excitement, hand slapping, and everyone was having a ball. Themeparkreview, Incrediblecoasters, the owners of Valleyfair, and even the park security joined in the fun. While I'm still depressed that the trip is over, I'm glad it at least went out with a bang.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikeaustinsing.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Words can not explain how amazing this trip was. So to make it even more amazing, Mike Austin sung Bohemiam Rhapsody by Queen to make one of the most epic moments in human history.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="arcade2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Luckily, the hotel was awesome and had a free arcade for me to drown my sorrows of leaving this awesome trip and saying good bye to everyone through viciously playing PacMan. Seriously, this trip was awesome and I can not wait for the trip that I will do.
