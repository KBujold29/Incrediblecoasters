We're here at SunSplash (Roseville), and we're here to ride their newest water slide, and a really strong one (2nd best in the park). Zoomerang. I know SunSplash technically doesn't need this since they already had a water coaster with Master Blaster. But that doesn't matter. Having two works really well for SunSplash. And Zoomerang is unquestionably one of the best water coasters. Only lacking behind Mammoth & Wildebeest @ <a href="OfficialHolidayWorldPage.html">Holiday World</a> and <a href="PelicanPlungePhotos.html">Pelican's Plunge @ New Wild Rivers</a>. So yeah. This is a really good one! All right. We head up the stairs, get in the tube and we're off! We head down a dip and gain some speed. We go through a couple turns that honestly kind of look like toilet bowls. While it would be nice to have some toilet bowl spinning in the middle of a water coaster, at least we go through these turns fast and gain some laterals. After these turns, we head down a fairly big drop. Wee! Gaining some speed! We then head up an uphill portion, and....we're going pretty far up. And hey. No ass massage from LIMs like on Master Blaster. That's really nice. There's even a little pop of airtime and a splash up front. That's nice. We go into another one of those toilet bowl turns. THey're really just there to catch you in case you get too many laterals and overshoot. They're there to potentially catch you. Hey. Happy this slide is having laterals like these. Go into another turn in a tunnel. Really having fun here. We pop down another drop before heading up another hill. WOW!!! THIS IS AWESOME!!! A FANTASTIC WATER COASTER!!! I can't wait to see what else it's gonna do! Another tight turn, and.....it's over. *Sigh* This has the exact same problem as Pelican's Plunge. Mainly in that they're both AMAZING water coasters, who share the same problem with being too short and being over too soon. Which is a real shame cause this is a GREAT water coaster that honestly could potentially be one of the best ever if it just kept going and was much longer. But considering how tight on space SunSplash is, I'm just happy we got what we got. Anyways, I TOTALLY recommend this slide if you're at SunSplash.
