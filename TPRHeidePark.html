  <img src="hotelportroyal.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We have arrived at the very awesome Hotel Port Royal for the night.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelportroyal2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No seriously. This place is so well themed that the toilets are well themed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="heidepark.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Check out the awesome view from our hotel room.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why yes. I would like to start out the morning on Heide Park's newest coaster, Krake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Krake is one of the new B&M Dive Machines.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This isn't quite as good as Sheikra.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But its still a really fun ride and a great fit for Heide Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="desertrace.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Our Morning ERT continued on Desert Race. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="desertrace2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Desert Race was a very interesting ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="desertrace3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was fun and had a lot of twisty bits, but there was just something that felt missing, but I don't quite know what. But hey, its still a really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="limit.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Lets just get this out of the way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="limit2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, you knew that we were gonna ride this sooner or later.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="limit3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it wasn't one of the worst SLCs ever, it certainly wasn't one of the best either.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahnHEIDE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well since the bobsled isn't on the the parks Flash Pass system, we decided to get that credit out of the way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahnHEIDE2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, these Mack Bobsleds are really fun rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahnHEIDE3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Is everyone ready to ride!!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="schweizerbobbahnHEIDE4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this bobsled was better than the one at Europa Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelportroyal3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Have to head on back to the hotel to grab something quickly. (Yeah. Thats our hotel. Nice, isn't it.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelportroyal4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Grr. Captain Jack Sparrow wants his beer and he wants it now!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDEline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh crap. Look at that line. Luckily, we don't have to wait that thanks to fast pass. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Its good. Really good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigloop.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for us to get yet another credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigloop2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were REALLY lucky to have fastpass for this ride since it not only had a long line, but was only running one train.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigloop3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And hey, it was running well. Smooth as glass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grottenblitz.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What is it with all these European Parks having great powered coasters?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign242.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see Cliff is going through withdrawls again. We better stop for more beer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beer4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey, it may be wheat beer, but it has alcohol, which is good enough for me."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="indyblitz.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Ceaser, do you approve of the kiddy coaster?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="heidepark2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, the park actually has a really well themed Wild West Area.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildwasserbahnHEIDE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Who's the dumbass who thought it'd be a good idea to ride the log ride in this weather?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="heidepark3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Where am I again?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Any time I can get a good Duner Kebab, I'm happy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="toilet2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those are the toilets? I think I'll just hold it in.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="heidepark4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Like most of these European Parks, Heide Park looks REALLY nice!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Lets all slide down this twisted mess of slides. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We're gonna race. Slide in 3...2...1!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those rollers hurt my ass SO BAD!!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone else wanna take another ride on Krake?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm really glad that more B&M Dive Machines are being built as these really are fun rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
NOM NOM NOM!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. The splash really is that high and you just might get wet. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krakemaze.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Krake Maze wasn't that scary. Come on guys!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="screamHEIDE.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, their drop tower Scream kicks ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Random slide in the middle of the park that we found.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDEline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm, looks like all the people from earlier cleared out. (Hmm, now you notice just how strange the Collosus line is in how its built on a slope.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I spy ejector air. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise13.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really wanted to buy one of these little figurines, but I couldn't afford it due to being broke. Plus, it probably would've broke in my suitcase.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="aquaspin.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We're getting into Flat Ride land. They have a Top Spin, an Enterprise, a Round Up...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ladymoon.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And this very bizarre flat ride that was a lot of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="entertainer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can I please try that!!? Come on, what could possibly go wrong!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, I would like to slide down more of these twisted mess of slides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundHEIDE.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Basic obstacles to get to the slide.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign243.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Warning. Your ass will catch on fire going down these slides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideHEIDE6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why can't any of our local playgrounds have slides like this? 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, there are so many shots to get up here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All that ejector air looks so beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="krake9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now you should really get an idea of just how big Krake's splash is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigloop4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Even the Big Loop shots are beautiful up here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigloop5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It looks so pretty. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterball2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Is it me being drunk, or are these things completely pointless?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kanalfahrt.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone else wanna take a ride on the Kanalfahrt.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kanalfahrt2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this stupid boat ride takes us inside the Grottenblitz building. I'm really glad to see Heide Park really taking advantage of all that they've got.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now we have Colossus ERT!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not quite as good as El Toro, but this is still one of the best wooden coasters ever!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I mean, just look at that airtime!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Towards the end of our ERT, the sky just opened up and it began to pour down on us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I got soaked and I loved it. Definetly one of the craziest ERT sessions I've ever experienced.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosusHEIDE10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, you can see all the rain in this picture.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And after our insane Colosus in the rain ERT, we went back to the hotel, warmed up, took a shower, and went down for a great dinner the hotel provided for us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="toilet3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Whatever you've been drinking, thats where you pee. Funny thing is that I saw a urinal for cocktails, whisky, brandy, coke, wine, wasser, water, but there's no urinal for beer!!! So where does Cliff go!!!?
