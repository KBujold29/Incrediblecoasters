Unfortunetly, this is our last park on the trip.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Here's a looka at what we'll be doing today.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
While I was worried about the rain after seeing the weather report and this sign, I was happy to know that the rain did not ruin my time at Dorney. (It did screw up my flight though.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="talon.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First ride of the day, Talon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="talon2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, I don't know how people came up with the idea that this coaster is badass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="talon3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is basically Silver Bullet's Eastern Sister.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="talon4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It is a fun ride though. No doubt about that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up was Hydra.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride was suprisingly great and awsome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really think everyone confuses Hydra with Talon as this ride is great.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
BEST ELEMENT ON A COASTER EVER!!!! NUFF SAID!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voodooDP.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello Steel Venom. Don't think I haven't forgotten about you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voodooDP2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
I have finally gotten that other Geauga Lake Credit. And that completes the Geauga Lake Credits.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voodooDP3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh Yeah. Voodoo was awsome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforce.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Up next is Steel Force.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforce2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This and a certain blue overrated coaster have a terrible thing in common.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforce3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not that they both have weak airtime hills.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforce4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And it's not the fact that they both exceed over 200 feet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforcerideoperator.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's that they both have Evil Ride Operators. The Steel Force Ride Operator, (AKA Christina), is only slightly better than the Millenium Force Ride Operator. And Honestly, you're a terrible and evil ride operator if you come anywhere close to  the Millenium Force Ride Operator's wrath. So being only *slightly* better really shows that she is a nasty bitch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforcerideoperator2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh Millenium Force Ride Operator, I miss you so much. I'm currently fu*king with this jackass teenager you fu*ked with last year. I really love seeing the anger in his eyes when he hears my nasty nasty voice. I was wondering if you had any ideas on coming up with bulls*it rules for this guy to break so he can be ejected from my land of Dorney Park. His confusion and anger would be so priceless to me. Oh I just wish I could eject that little bastard out of here right now! You really need to get away from Cedar Point and come to Dorney Park. If we combine our evil together, than we can truely make Dorney Park the most misreble place on earth!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steelforcerideoperator3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While this time I tried to Stand up to the Steel Force Ride Operator, I just got knocked down. Everyone else that tried to stand up for me also got knocked down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lazer.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, let's try and get onto something positive and get on Laser.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lazer2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was alot like what Scorpian would be like if it had two loops and more force.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="lazer3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's a shame this is Laser's last year. There are lot of other things at Dorney Park that should go besides Laser.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkDP.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was Thunderhawk.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkDP2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thunderhawk is a very strange woodie.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkDP3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It seems like the ride used to be good until it got raped by useless trims.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dominatorDP.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Although I didn't ride it, the S&S Towers @ Dorney do look good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign45.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. So I can go up to Geauga Lake's grave, stick this ticket in the grave, and a hot dog will pop out of it's grave? Awsome!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="whitewaterlanding.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I just know Cody is dreaming of soaking himself from White Water Landing. Just look at that splash. (Oh yeah, I rode that.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildmouseDP.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While drying off, we decided to get the final credit at the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildmouseDP2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It just wasn't a good Wild Mouse. There's a much better Wild Mouse just 60 miles away at Hersheypark.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="meteor.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We rode the one at Kennywood. We don't need to do two of these in the same trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="talon5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
We tried riding Talon in the middle to see if it was any better. While it's better in the middle, It's just not that badass ride many claim it is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So we decided to get our final ride of the day on the underrated and unique Hydra.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Honestly, This ride is just so unique that it's just awsome. Scream, Medusa, and Dominator arn't anything like this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hydra7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I still love that element and wish more coasters would have it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="airgate.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And this trip ended by spending the night at the Chicago O'Hare Airport. While there a few bad moments on the trip, (Steel Force Ride Operators), Most of this trip was just amazing with amazing rides and amazing people. This trip was just so great and I hope to do another trip soon.
