Well, the day has finally come. The day that we went to the L.A County Fair. Now due to being busy and having a hard time fitting things in my schedule, I wasn't even really planning on going to the L.A County Fair at first. This was a total last minute idea for me because F*ck it!! I wanna go to a fair, eat some deep fried food, and I'm not going a year without one of the best flat rides ever!!! Tango!!!! So at the last minute, here I go!!! And yeah. It is INSANELY crowded today. I was NOT expecting it to be this bad.

</center>
<center>
Now due to being in financial lockdown for all of my expenses for next years travel plans, I couldn't really spend much money and go on many rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Still one of the best flat rides out there.

Seeing Lynyrd Skynyrd would've been nice, but I'm stripped for cash and I've already seen Big Bad Voodoo Daddy and Primus this year, and Andrew W.K is coming up soon. I'm good.

</center>
<center>
If the male is called a peacock, does that make the female a peac*nt? (Yes, I know the answer is no. It's a peahen. Don't be such a lameass about it.)

Before you become impressed, realize that this is not a cake, but rather just sugar art.

And yeah. That was my L.A County Fair visit for this year. As you can see, it was MUCH smaller than my plans from <a href="LACountyFair2011.html">previous</a> <a href="LACountyFair2012.html">years</a>. But I still had fun and got on my favorite rides. So that's all good. Hoping to make next year a much grander visit to the Fair.
