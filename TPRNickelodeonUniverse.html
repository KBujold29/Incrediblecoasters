My big trip has finally come. TPR's Middle America Trip. I can not say enough good things about this trip. So I'll show it all to you in this bigass update. First off, we started our Day Zero at the Mall of America.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mallofamerica2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wait a minute? How the hell is a mall Incrediblecoasters friendly? If we don't care for shopping at all, why the hell did we fly out 2,000 miles to some bigass mall?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nickelodeonuniverse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. They have a theme park in here. (And for it's size, it packs quite a punch.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nickelodeonuniverse2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, I mostly just filmed around on Day 0 due to the fact that I wasn't paying to ride these when I can get them for nothing tomorrow.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ikea.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Instead, we all went over to Ikea. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ikea2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bed the ride. It goes from 0 to 0 in 0. That's infinity folks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ikea3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see a bad case of puppy love.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ikea4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hmm. I wonder what color the green room is?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ikea5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is way better than any stupid theme park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mallofamerica3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oops. Sorry Nickelodeon Universe. I didn't mean it. You're totally better than the Ikea.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doraswheel.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you ever need to explore Nickelodeon Universe, just hop on Dora's wheel and she'll help you explore the place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebob.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nickelodeon Universe is approved by Spongebob.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Speaking of Spongebob, I look foreword to riding you tomorrow.

<center>
I would like a moment of silence from everyone. Today at Incrediblecoasters, we have lost a beloved member. The Canon ZR 500 has died. =( R.I.P Canon ZR 500. Bought in <a href="Hawaii.html">Hawaii</a> in November 2006, and died in Minneapolis in August 2010, the Canon ZR 500 has lived a long healthy life serving for Incrediblecoasters. If you go to our Youtube Channel, you will see that with the exception of Volumes 1 & 2 Crap and all stuff from this trip and beyond were filmed with that video camera. It has filmed all sorts of wonders for us. From many backstage tours, to Coaster's Crazy Ejector Air, to Geauga Lake's last breath of life, to Maverick's Godliness, it has served us on many trips and general updates. And even though it died right at the begenning of a huge trip, it's workload has been more than paid off. And now, the Canon ZR 500 lives on in the memories of Incrediblecoasters, and through all the awesome stuff it filmed for us. Farewell, Canon ZR 500.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bestbuy.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of coures, common sense will tell you that Incrediblecoasters would NEVER do a huge trip to many parks that we have never been to before and NOT get any footage. And since my still camera isn't of high enough quality to play the role of video camera, a trip to Best Buy was in order. (Luckily I was in a giant mall at the time of the Canon ZR 500's death.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="camera6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Incrediblecoasters still camera. It's one of your millions of identical twins. Of course, this camera will never be as cool as you as it will most likely be used to take photos of boring events like birthday parties, and weddings, and graduations, and not cool stuff like this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="camera7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This camera may be cheap and not that great, but I still love it, because without it, there would be no Middle America footage at all. (Too bad that was the only thing I could afford.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="camera8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to the Incrediblecoasters family Samsung Camcorder.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vendingmachine.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may look like an ordinary hotel vending machine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vendingmachine2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wrong. This one sells sex and drugs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nickelodeonuniverse3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. The TPR Middle America Trip has officially begun!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only did we have Spongebob ERT...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="avatar.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But we also had bonus Avatar ERT!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="avatar2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
This may have been my first Intamin Half Pipe, but it certainly won't be my last. These things kick ass!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="avatar3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These things spin like crazy. It's completely awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="avatar4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Every mall should have an Avatar clone in it. Especially the stupid Ventura one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, back to Spongebob ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Spongebob also has the "Goliath Effect" where it slows down dramatically at the top of the lifthill.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Loop de Loop!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Spongebob also manages to have a cutback.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Zero G Roll on Spongebob is actually quite good. You get some wicked hangtime there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You want me to quit it with the nerdy coaster captions?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pepsiorangestreak.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ERT may be over, but that's not a problem since this park is so deserted.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pepsiorangestreak2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Pepsi Orange Streak. It's big. It's long. That's about it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pepsiorangestreak3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's sort of what Jaguar would be like if they put it in a mall.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pepsiorangestreak4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may be the Pepsi Orange Streak, but really. This ride is all about American Girl.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pepsiorangestreak5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Insert "Pepsi Orange Streak Randomness" caption here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="barnyardhayride.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know this isn't even a credit guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="barnyardhayride2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't look at me!! I'm ashamed of my credit whoring self!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="brainsurge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was Nickelodeon Universe's latest crazy flat ride. Brain Surge. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="brainsurge2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
THIS THING KICKS ASS!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="brainsurge3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just imagine the self controled 2 person Top Spin from the Santa Monica Pier combined with a teacup ride, and you pretty much get Brain Surge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backyardianswings.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Time for an Incrediblecoasteres Dumbass moment. I knew that Nickelodeon Universe had these chairswings with backwards seats. But somehow, I didn't get on them. Oh, the regret I have now. (Well, at least Cody made the same dumbass mistake I did during his visit.) 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fairlyoddcoasterNU.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Final Credit of the day. The Fairly Odd Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fairlyoddcoasterNU2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fairly Odd Coaster with the backwards swings I missed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fairlyoddcoasterNU3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, I've seen many coasters like this and even rode a clone of this at Worlds of Fun. And last time I checked, clones were fairly common. Guess this should be renamed to the Fairly Common Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fairlyoddcoasterNU4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fairly Common Coaster through the trees. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fairlyoddcoasterNU5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fairly Odd Coaster was actually a really good spinner.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="foodcourt.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time to get food.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mcdonalds.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This McDonalds is extra Incrediblecoasters friendly. Why is that?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mcdonalds2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This McDonalds serves Mtn Dew!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign129.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Food and Pepsi sitting in a tree.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logchute.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, Log Chute.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logchute2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey? Where's the Hooters at the end of the light!!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logchute3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This Log Flume is still one of the best.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logchute4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPLOOSH!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logchute5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, that's not a blurry picture. The Log Flume really is that fast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jimmyneutronsatomiccollider.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What the hell is this?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jimmyneutronsatomiccollider2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! It's a Tapico Tumbler Style Ride!!! These things are awesome!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jimmyneutronsatomiccollider3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Stupid Knotts Berry Farm. Why did you have to remove Tapico Tumbler? These are awesome!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikodrumgame6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!! They have the Taiko Drum Game here!! Unfortunetly, I couldn't play due to being broke from buying my video camera.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="splatosphere.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, the Splat-O-Sphere.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="splatosphere2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Giant Frog Hoppers rule.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
More Spongebob Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghostblasters.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They even have a shooting dark ride in here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghostblasters2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be anything special, but it's still a fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghostblasters3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
DON'T SHOOT!!! WE SURRENDER!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="takattack.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They even managed to fit a Hammerhead style ride in here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="takattack2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think it's safe to say that Nickelodeon Universe is pretty much Knotts Berry Farm flat ride heaven.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flyingdutchmanropescourse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nickelodeon Universe also has their very own Ropes Course here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flyingdutchmanropescourse2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, I was unable to do it since it was an upcharge. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flyingdutchmanropescourse3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It actually looked like a pretty challenging course.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flyingdutchmanropescourse4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I think I just sh*t myself."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="flyingdutchmanropescourse5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
AARRGH!!!! YOU SHALL WALK THY PLANK!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge10.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And now, time for more Spongebob rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm really gonna miss this ride. It packs a powerful little punch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebobsquarepantsrockbottomplunge12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Enjoy your hangtime guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bucadibeppo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, time for dinner at Buca di Beppos.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bucadibeppo2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Buca di Beppos is a family style resteraunt, where they just brings you loads and loads of food to eat.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bucadibeppo3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was one hell of a meal.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
BUMP THE NUNS!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Are these girls eating sphagetti or vomiting it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Eew. No thanks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="partybus3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We may have a long drive to the middle of nowhere Iowa, but that's OK. We can pass the time by playing "Ask Robb a question."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign130.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hooray!!! We made it to the land of Blue Bunny!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we made it to our hotel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place was f*cking tiny!! It was like the Bates Motel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lounge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We may be stuck in the middle of nowhere Iowa, but dammit! We're gonna have a good time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="snackexchange.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First up, we had our snack exchange. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="snackexchange2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
People from all over the world broguht snacks and candy from all over the world to share.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doritos.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's my contribution to the snack exchange. (Divv, you better have appreciated those doritos.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doritos2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"GRR!!!! I APPRECIATE ALL MY DORITOS KEVIN!!! NOW LEAVE ME ALONE WHILE I MAKE SWEET LOVE TO MY DORITOS!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doubledecker.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news is that some of the brits brought Double Deckers!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doubledecker2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The bad news is that the Double Decker was a dissapointment. =( Now Don't get me wrong. Double Deckers are still very good and above the average American Candy, but they wern't even the best thing at the snack exchange. It may just be the fact that I'm not much of a chocolate person. But the Double Decker did not live up to it's hype.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lesliehall.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To spice up the middle of nowhere, we brought Leslie Hall.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lesliehall2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Leslie, I don't feel very comfortable with you in that position."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lesliehall3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"There we go. That's much better."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lesliehall4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not even the snacks were safe from Leslie Hall.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lesliehall5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. Incrediblecoasters has met a celebrity.
