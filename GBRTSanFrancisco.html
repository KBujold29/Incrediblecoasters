So, a couple months ago, we found a place online called Glass Beach and found it really cool and wanted to go there sometime. A couple days later, Cody pitched the idea of us doing a Northern California Road Trip where we go to Glass Beach. Throw in exploring San Francisco and getting some rides in on the Giant Dipper and we have ourselves a 3 day road trip. And keep in mind, this is the first ever Incrediblecoasters Road Trip. Now you know we've done many major trips before. That's how we've gotten on all these credits across North America and Europe. But this is the very first multiple day trip we've done completely on our own, without any aid from anyone. This is a solely Incrediblecoasters Trip. There was no help from any groups like Theme Park Review, Thrill Coaster Tours, etc. The entire trip was planned and financed ourselves. Before this, we had only done single day trips on our own. And man was it an awesome trip for our first ever Incrediblecoasters Road Trip.

I always came here for Cross Country races back in High School, so it was nice to come here, see the places beauty without being covered in sweat running away from the rock.

Next stop!!! Black Sand Beach in Central California right off the PCH.
</center>

<center>
Yes, you can go past the fence. Though you can't actually get down to the beach since its on a cliff.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="beach8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Its a cool beach where the sand looks sort of black, but its not too special. Now there's a beach in Greece that actually does have black sand that I want to go to. But this'll do for now.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign254.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yep. They had to put up a sign that says "No sh*tting on the beach."
</center>

 <p>

"Hello Mountain. Hope you like fog, cause I've got some special fog just for you." =)

</center>
<center>
Ok. This backstage tour drive is worth the 10 minute hold up.

</center>
<center>
Apparently, this place is not only famous for the beach, but also this wheel. The beach, I can totally see why. But why this wheel? Are there just wooden wheel enthusiasts who come here to check it out?

Since we were right by, we decided to stop by California's Great America and get some Gold Striker construction photos.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker2.JPG">
</center>
<center>

Group Photo of us on the awesome Japanese Tea Garden Bridge. And BTW, if you look at the reflection of the bridge, it forms a perfect 360 degree circle. We didn't know this till after the trip and are kicking ourselves for not checking it out. But whatever. I don't mind coming back here next year. But I just want to tell you now in case you're going to San Francisco any time soon.
