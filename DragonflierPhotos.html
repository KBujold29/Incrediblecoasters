We're here at Dollywood to ride Dragonflier. A Family Inverted Coaster from Vekoma. And I have to say. They really are improving with these things. They started out with the Kiddy SLCs (both the <a href="BatPhotos.html">regular ones</a> and the <a href="JimmyNeutronsAtomicFlyerPhotos.html">slightly smaller ones</a> that are much better due to their lap bars). Then they came out with a bigger <a href="KvastenPhotos.html">Family Suspended Coaster</a> that was a lot of fun. And finally, we have Dragonflier. The biggest model of them all (It's been <a href="OrkanenPhotos.html">cloned</a> repeately). And this thing is good. I know it's just a family coaster and not that intense. But this ride is just a whole lot of fun. All right. Let's hop in the trains, pull down the lap bars (Seriously, those original Kiddy SLCs need lap bars put in ASAP), and away we go. We roll around a turn and climb the lifthill. All right. We're at the top, and we head down the first drop. It's slightly curved, but for the most part, straight. It's weird. We just sort of head down at first, but we don't really gain much speed until we're halfway down and then we just are off. Kind of awkward, but OK. It's still fun. We then dive into a small tunnel. TAKE THE TUNNEL!!! But before you can finish the overused joke, you're out of the tunnel and whipping around this really tight overbanked turn. You don't think much of it since its small, but it actually has a nice little punch. We're now just gliding through some straight track. We then head around a turn, up a small hill, and through a small helix to the ground. We head up another small hill over the station, only to again, head down into a small helix towards the ground. We then head around a couple turns that are really low to the ground. We then head into a small dip. We then head through a sharp banked turn, and...STATION!!! We just glide right into the station. So that's Dragonflier. This ride may not be that intense, but it is just fun. And definetly stronger than it looks (Orkanen is still better due to the setting). It's just such an enjoyable and relaxing ride. And hey, this model of Vekoma Family Suspended Coasters is growing in popularity, with some more clones popping up in Poland and China. So give this coaster a ride. It's just a lot of fun.
