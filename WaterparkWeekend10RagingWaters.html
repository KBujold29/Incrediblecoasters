Ok. So this summer, we decided to go to both Raging Waters and Wild Rivers and have a Waterpark Weekeknd. (Don't be fooled by the name. The visits were a week apart.) Anyways, we went back to Raging Waters for a very specific reason.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
To get more rides on High Extreme because we love that ride on Incrediblecoasters!! =)
</center>

<center>
We have arrived at Raging Waters. 
</center> 

<p>

</center>
<center>
Actually, the real reason we came was to see their new slide, Dr. Von Dark's Tunnel of Terror since it seemed awesome in the commercials.
</center> 

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Dr. Von Dark is a new ProSlide Tantrum. And as you can see, they definetly looked cool.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="drvondarkstunnelofterror3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
However, in true Raging Waters Style, it turned out to be overhyped and not nearly as good as expected. But it was still fun.
</center>

No caption needed.

</center>
<center>
Next up, Neptunes Fury.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
 <img src="neptunesfury4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The only fury this ride has is the ability to produce really long slow moving lines.
</center> 

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="neptunesfury5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, at least the ending is good.
</center> 

 <p>

</center>
<center>
While Raging Waters may be overrated in the waterslide department, they are certinly doing a good job in the food department.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="baconhotdog3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Mmm. Bacon Hot Dog. *Drool*
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="dropout2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Last time I was here, I didn't do Drop Out due to the line. So this time, I made sure to do it.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="dropout3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. Venom Drop was much bigger. Once again, overrated.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="dragonsden3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, Dragons Den.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="dragonsden4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a lot faster last time and we didn't vally in the bowl. So that's an improvement. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="dragonsden5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dragons Den is fun, but Bazooka Bowls is the real toilet bowl.
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
So your the bastard who got Raging River removed! 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="ragingracer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only was this ride responsible for Raging Racer's death, but it's trimmed!!! Yeah, I really don't like this Bamboo Racer Clone all that much.
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Damn!! Good thing we rode Dr. Von Dark this morning.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="waterbucket4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, the kiddy area still looks nice.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="speedslides.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, we tried the Speed Slides.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="speedslides2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike all the other slides here, Speed Slides did not dissapoint!! It's easily the best slide here! You even get airtime on it!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="waterbucket5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To get to Vortex, you have to go through the kiddy area.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="vortex2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For some strange reason, we decided to ride Vortex @ Raging Waters. (We're really stupid.)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="vortex3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While most of the ride is just plain boring, the first few feet of the slide felt really cracked and out of shape. I thought I cut my back and the rest of the ride was awkward cause I kept thinking it was going to cut me.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="highextreme9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Crap. I've trying to avoid this ride all day.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="highextreme10.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
More good news. High Extreme doesn't suck the way it did 5 years ago. Perhaps those Bamboo Racer mats actually make you go faster. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
The star attraction at Raging Waters however, isn't even a water slide. Nope. The star attraction at Raging Waters is indeed the Flowrider.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
 <img src="flowrider2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now those who know me are probably saying "WTF?" to that last statement since I have a fear of waves and hate surfing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
 <img src="flowrider3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The reason I love the flowrider, but hate surfing is because when you wipe out on the flowrider, you can actually breathe, wheras you can't in real surfing. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
 <img src="flowrider4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may have flopped like a fish in a frying pan, but I loved it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
 <img src="locker.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And throughout the day, we managed to put all of our stuff in that tiny little locker.
