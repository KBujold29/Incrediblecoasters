The next stop was Knoebels. Although we only had two hours there, so we couldn't do alot of stuff, but anyways, onto Knoebels.
</center>

<p>

Knoebels is a very strange park as it has alot of weird rides, weird buildings, and it's in the middle of freaking nowhere! (The Ferris Wheel is not one of their wierd rides.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="knoebels3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And there's no parking lot. 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
I assume Knoebels makes their own bread as they have a building shaped like a loaf of bread.
</center>

Ooh! Look at that weird funky flat ride. I want to ride it.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, we don't have time for that funky flat ride as we only have 2 hours here and we HAVE to get the major woodies in.
</center>

<p>

<center>
<img src="twisterKN4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Anyways, Twister is one of the woodies at Knoebels.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="twisterKN2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
As you can see, the ride is very twisted.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Having fun, Good because when you get off, we're running to the next attraction.
</center>

Hey Bitch! That last photo you saw, it was taken from the exit ramp.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
On Incrediblecoasters, we've had millions of gum things. Like Golrusher has a gum spot, X2 has a gum support, and Medusa has a gum exit. Well, the new record for most gum goes to Twister's Gum Exit! See that right there, there's about a dozen of these in Twister's Exit!

<center>
One really good food item Knoebels has is Cesaris Pizza. Scarfing down that pizza was very good.
</center>

</center>

<center>
Games? We don't have time for Games! We have more rides to get on and are running out of time VERY quickly.
</center>

<p>

<center>
Ok, before we rush on with our 2 hours at Knoebels, let's learn a little about Flying Turns.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flyingturns2.jpg">
</center>
<center>

Flying Turns was supposed to be their new ride, but it's been constantly postponed for years and years.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flyingturns3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Pictures of the Flying Turns it was modeled after in the 1900s.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Here is what the actual ride looks like.

</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
And here are the cars you will ride in.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Ok, back to our rushed 2 hours at Knoebels. Now it's time to go on the other wooden coaster they have, Phoinex.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="phoenix2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
It starts out by going in a dark smelly tunnel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="phoenix3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
But after the lift hill, the ride is nothing but PURE EJECTOR AIR!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="phoenix4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Phoinex has officially become my #1 Wooden Coaster.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Now that we have ridden both of the woodies here, we can do some crazy flat rides. Unfortunetly, we could not go on Knoebels legendary Flyers today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="loopen.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Instead, we rode this f**ked up flat ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="loopen2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
It was just like a fair ride. Fun, Looks like it will kill you, and brutal on your thighs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="powersurge.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And we also got on Power Surge as well.
</center>

<p>

<center>
<img src="powersurge2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
This ride is so awsome it makes grown men scream like little girls.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="powersurge3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, after the craziness of Power Surge, our 2 hours were up.
