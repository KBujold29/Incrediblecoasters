All right. We're now at our second park. Six Flags Magic Mountain. Nothing too special today, though Fright Fest is here, and it's always good to get more Halloween fun.

OK. We're at one of the biggest coaster parks in the country. So yeah. Of course we're going to do one of their star attractions. Twisted Collosus.

Funny they did all the maintanance work earlier in the year on Tidal Wave, just so it can be open for the Fall (though to be fair, it did run late in the summer).

In a shocking twist, I actually wound up not doing any of the Fright Fest mazes. I know I went in expecting to do them. But I just did Knotts Scary Farm, and those mazes are much better. Combine that with the fact that I'm still in financial lockdown, and I spent a lot of money in October, and I decided to sit out the Fright Fest mazes this year. They probably would've been a letdown after Knotts Scary Farm anyways. Plus, I've done a lot of them.

But hey. More good news. X2 does have its Fright Fest audio. Well, at least part of it. It had the audio on the lifthill and brake run. But the actual ride had no audio. Eh, that's fine. Those are the times where it really matters, though you do notice not having Beastie Boys playing in the background (or Drowning Pool in the case of Fright Fest).

I know part of me was looking foreward to trying the Gargoyles Halloween VR. But in all honesty, just having Revolution work and not have horrendous operations thanks to VR is even better. Yeah. This was the right choice.

What's that? You're not scared by any of the Fright Fest monsters? Well maybe Scream will do the trick. NOW SCREAM!!!

Well, we are here for Fright Fest. Not just roller coasters. Let's check out some of the scare areas.

Hey, they did a fairly good job here. OK. Not as good as the scare zones at Knotts Scary Farm, but I still enjoyed it all.

I see you getting in the Halloween spirit. Hanging that vampire cutout in the station. Very spooky. ;)
