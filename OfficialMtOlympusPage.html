I'm just going to come out and admit it. I f*cking hate this park. There is no doubt about it. This is by far the worst park I have ever visited. I mean, I'm no fan of <a href="OfficialLaRondePage.html">La Ronde</a>. But compared to this place, it's freaking Disney World!!!! This place is so bad, that it almost astonishes me. The management here is so awful, it is just mind boggling. If you've read my update on Mt. Olympus, you'll see several different rants about the park. Most of them I still hold by. Though I will update one. When I mentioned that the employees didn't bother to show up on time, I don't think the employee was actually late. I think that upper management just said "Don't bother showing up till 2 hours after the park opens. Thats when your shift will start". So to be fair to the employees, they were probably just showing up at the time they were told to show up at. But honestly, that still makes the park suck. Why are you not telling your employees to show up when the park opens? Why are opening some of your most popular coasters hours after the park opens? Are you really that cheap? And if you're going to be lazy and cheap like that, could you at least put up a f*cking sign that tells guests when you will be opening up? You know, guests just love waiting around for 30 minutes for a ride to open. Not knowing how long we'll be standing here. Thats just a great way to treat the people spending money in your theme park. I'm so glad that you're thinking so much about them. And then of course, there's a million other things about this park that I ranted about in my update such as the Cyclops Age Limit, wasting time on stupid things when there are such obvious flaws to go over that the park is ignoring, beyond disgusting operations, not taking good care of their rides, only buying one train out of cheapness and greed. And don't even get me started on that Opa accident. Seriously? Oh, how I hate this park oh so much.

Now I didn't ride any flat rides at Mt. Olympus. I didn't do so because A: I didn't have any time to do so with all the huge lines in the park. B: This park barely has any flat rides. Seriously, some bumper cars, and kiddy flats. Thats all this park has. Go f*cking nuts.

Mt. Olympus certainly isn't lacking in the water slide section, hosting TWO Water Parks. One indoors and one outdoors. They seem fun I guess, though I'm sure that their operations are horrendous. I've also heard some horrendous things about how their lifeguards don't pay attention to anything!!! Come on assholes!!! Pay attention!!! I mean I spent three years working at P2 (Idiot Control) at SFMM!!!! It's not that hard!!! DO YOUR F*CKING JOB!!!! But they do have a wave pool with 10 ft waves. That's cool I guess. But it just doesn't seem worth the hassle.

All right. The food at Mt. Olympus is nothing to crazy or exciting. Its pretty much just typical amusement park crap. Now, this isn't horrible or anything. It seems about on par with an average Six Flags park. Not bad, but nothing to go nuts over. But really, when you compare that to the rest of the park, but the food is one of the best things here. And the saddest part is that my meal was included with the tour. I've read horror stories about prices, and knowing Mt. Olympus, I believe each and every one of them.

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Mt Olympus. Well as for theming, there's absolutely none. None whatsoever. I know that the park is supposed to be themed to Ancient Greece, but man, oh man. Its not. They may have names based of Greek Mythology like Hades and Zeus, but this place has no theming at all. Its like a Family Entertainment Center with its theming. Hell, even those are better themed than Mt. Olympus. <a href="OfficialCastleParkPage.html">Castle Park</a> has better theming than this place. But whatever. As for other stuff to do, there's one other thing here. Go karts. This place is big on go karts. If you're a go kart person, you'll love this place. They have some fantastic go kart tracks over here. This isn't just your typical concrete track like most places have, these courses have dips, bridges, tunnels, giant spirals, they have great layouts. However, as cool as they look, they are not worth the 4 hour lines that they produce. I mean, Holy Sh*t!!! Not worth it!!! I only did one track since it was a 15 minute wait. And wouldn't you have guessed it, it was the lame course with no dips, no spirals, no tunnels, no nothing. Though I will admit it was still cooler than most other go kart tracks. At least it would've been if it weren't for the drivers. OH MY GOD!!!! THESE PEOPLE ARE THE WORST DRIVERS EVER!!!!!! I mean, what the hell is wrong with people in Wisconson!!!? They clearly don't understand the concept of brakes, because not only did they rear end me when I was driving, but when I was in line, I must have seen at least 20 people get rear ended on these Go Karts. If thats how people in Wisconson drive, then I'd be scared for my life driving on the freeways here. Oh, there's also a petting zoo here. But the way its run, you'd swear it was an exhibit of animals suffering from clinical depression. The goats there would be much better off eaten and made into stuff goats get made into than living in this petting zoo.

Mt. Olympus sucks. It sucks bad and it sucks hard. This place is awful. While the coasters there do have potential, the lack of maintenence and care given to the rides really makes them deteriorate. I mean, You could tell that if the park took care of Hades, it'd be an amazing ride. But you can just tell that they just put minimal effort into the rides, only buying one train and all. Though Cyclops still has its moment of super insane ejector air. But even then, with that and all the cool looking go karts that the park has, they are not worth the insane waits that this place produces. I mean 4-5 hours for the coasters and the go karts. Seriously not worth it. But the park doesn't care that the line is 4 hours long. They'll just doddle around having 5 minute dispatches all while texting their friends about whatever stupid stuff is going on in their lives. God help them if they have to actually do their job!!!!!! No!!!! Those poor poor employees!!!!! Having to actually put some effort in their work. How sad. Cry me a river. While you can tell that this place was never meant to be Disneyland, it was meant to be fun and not the clusterf*ck of anger, frustration, and disbelief that is the park today. Its sad because I can see this place being a lot of fun under different management. Unfortunetly, it's gonna take quite a lot of work to turn this place around. Well, it's gonna be quite a long time before I bother coming back. Lets hope that they'll make some progress between now and then in becoming a fun place.

*Are there kiddy coaster restrictions? - Yes and No. There's a maximum height limit for Little Titans. So if you're reading this, you're most likely unable to get that credit. But hey, at least you can ride Pegasus. I'm so glad that Mt. Olympus is putting their resources into enforcing this rule instead of wasting their time on pesky things like operations, capacity, and making sure people don't fall out of their barely spinning mouse coasters.

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<font color="#00FF00">
*GET HERE EARLY!!!!!!!!!!! If you don't get all the credits super early in the morning when the park opens, they'll have 4-5 hour lines.
<p>
<center>
*I'm not sure about their POV Policy. It could swing either way, but I'm assuming No until I hear Yes.
</center>
<center>
<font size="1">
Knowing how lazy the operators here though, I'd imagine sneaking a POV would be incredibly easy. Hell, I'd imagine the operators being too busy taking selfies to notice or care.

<p>

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<font color="#00FF00">
<center>
*Be sure to bring an Ipod/Iphone/Ipad/friends to help make all the lines less painful.
<p>
<center>
*If do any of the go karts, don't be surprised if you end up getting rear ended.
<p>
<center>
*Make sure you stop by Timber Falls and ride Hellcat. It's a 10 minute walk away from Mt. Olympus, better run than Mt. Olympus despite being a Golf'N'Stuff style Family Entertainment Center with very few rides, and HellCat is a much better wooden coaster than any of the wooden coasters here. 
<p>
<center>
*Let me just say this again, since its so important. GET THERE EARLY!!!!!!!!!
<p>
<center>
*Despite all of the parks painful and disgusting problems, still at least try to have some fun.

I have yet to make a video for Mt. Olympus. The operations are so slow that you'd be there all day to get 30 minutes of shots to make a video. So one ins't coming soon.
