After our Lights on Euro Sat ERT this morning, we had a very long bus drive. And yeah, I'm having a very healthy lunch of PrinGOALS!!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="germantown.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Driving through a cute little German town.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="germantown2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It kind of reminds me of Solvang.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fortfun.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Are we really going to a theme park today? 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fortfun2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Todays park is this screwed up little park called Fort Fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. First up, lets get our Vekoma Roller Skater credit while we're here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmineline2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Whoops. It appears we entered the Fun House by mistake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmineline.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. Turns out that Devils Mine has the COOLEST LINE EVER!!!! Yes, that includes Dueling Dragons line. This is better. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, that line was better than an actual roller skater.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WHOA!!! Look at the custom layout!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In the back seat, theres actually some ejector air on this Roller Skater. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After the insane first drop, its mostly just helixes.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="devilsmine6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Still by far the best Vekoma Roller Skater I've ridden.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crazywashhouse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets go check out their fun house.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crazywashhouse2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is there a roller skater at the end of this fun house as well?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crazywashhouse3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Going crazy in the Crazy Washhouse!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="secretstageofhorror.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets see just how scary their horror house is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="secretstageofhorror2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This isn't that scary. Tell you what, I want you to call my friend Antonio and ask him if he can help fix up this ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="darkraver.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I have no idea what this is. Lets find out and see if its cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="darkraver2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
DUDE!!!! IT'S AN INDOOR ROUND UP!!! THATS SO BADASS!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="playgroundFORTFUN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These things were designed for people of my size. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! More insane Slides of Death!!!! Must check out!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, we are not being immature right now. These were designed for us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Tell my mom that I love her."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep, this slide was super fast and I flew off at the bottom.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildwasserbahn.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, anyone in the mood to get wet?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildwasserbahn2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a really good log flume. The first drop was underground so there was an entire underground section, and it was just fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tomahawk.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! A park that has Magnum!!! Awesome!!!! It ran a good program and is themed to Native Americans!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm, do I want to take the stairs down or slide on down to the lower level? Gee, such a hard decision. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="blueseamonster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Patrick!!! Its your favorite ride!!!! =D
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, lets just get the Tivoli credit out of the way since its the only coaster not on our ERT schedule.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, just be glad that this is the smallest coaster in the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know these Tivoli coasters are just a ton of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
THROUGH THE TREES!!!!!!
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Watch your head.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marienkaferbahn6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The operator was awesome, sending us around over and over and always giving us high fives.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedsnake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. This is the last coaster we need here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedsnake2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh. Its a Vekoma Corkscrew. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedsnake3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know I've never ridden the Whirlwind model before and I've loved everything in the park so far. Maybe this'll be a fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedsnake4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!! THIS RIDE IS HORRIBLE AND ROUGH AS HELL!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slideFORTFUN6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You're gonna need some rope to get up to the top of the hill.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildeagle.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Our ERT has begun, and first up, we'll be hitting up the parks Zipline. Wild Eagle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildeagle2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lets get suited up for this thing. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildeagle3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This thing is PRETTY high up. Better not have a fear of heights.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildeagle4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While its not really scary, its very fast and very fun, giving you a great view of these German Mountains.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, we get to the parks star attraction. The Alpine Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'd never been on an Alpine Coaster, so this was a really exciting treat for me, especially after hearing that it is one of the better ones.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"THIS IS F*CKING AWESOME!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hope you like lifthills, cause this ones 3.5 minutes long.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its a long way down. Lets make this fun. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. When you ride without any brakes, this thing is totally INSANE!!!!! (As seen by this blurry photo).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trapperslider7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm gonna stay here for the rest of ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ERT may be over, but now we get our Group Meal.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You'd think that you wouldn't be able to top ERT on an insane brakeless Alpine Coaster, but nope. Fort Fun topped it with our meal. Now normally they just give you food, but not here. They let us cook our own food. Not only did they let us BBQ an unlimited amount of meat, but they also gave us unlimited beer and sodas. Yeah. It was insane.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cocksauce.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, I'd really like the juice from my cock on my meat please.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey David & Brittney!!! Don't you wish you were here with us enjoying all this meat!!? (Hey, with all this free beer, David would get so drunk so quickly we could just lie and tell him that its veggie meat and he'd believe us!!!) 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may very well rank as one of the best meals I ever had. It was just so awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Grr!!! Gimme more meat and beer!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanging.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh, all this happiness just makes me want to kill myself.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Would you like your meat well done or burnt to a crisp?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseshoeBBQ7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uncooked Bratswurt or Dan's dick?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanging2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We have thrills, meat, women, and beer. The only thing missing from this Male Fantasy was violence. So we fixed that and hung Colin.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="slug.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is that part of the meat you're giving us Fort Fun?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="truck.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After our amazing day at Fort Fun, we just had to get stuck behind the Ass-Man's truck.
