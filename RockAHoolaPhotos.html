We're here at Cowabunga Bay Las Vegas (Henderson), where we'll be reveiwing Rock-A-Hoola. The park's tube bowl slide. They're fun. But not nearly as good as the Body Bowls. So basically, you grab your tube, head up the stairs.  Then you get to the top where you see a big curved drop into the bowl. You grab your tube, plop it in the water, then when its clear, the worker pushes you out. But this one is different. You see, this one isn't just a straight drop into the toilet bowl. Nope. This one actually has a little bit of an appetizer before we get to the good stuff. For this one has a bonus helix beforehand. And the inside of it has colored lights that make it seem like we're going faster. You sure this is the Toilet Bowl slide and not just a standard water slide? Nope. There comes the big drop. The drop is fun. Standard, but not only does the appetizer helix help, but there's more lights in the drop. So hooray for that. Once you make it to the bowl, you take a couple rides around the bowl. Then you go down a drop out of the bowl. And...this one is actually bigger since....this one actually feels like a legit drop. As far as Tube Bowls go, this is easily one of the better ones. Since hey. There's actually more to this slide than just the Toilet Bowl. However, it's still not as good as the Body Bowls. I would recommend riding this if it has a short line or have never been on a Toilet Bowl.
