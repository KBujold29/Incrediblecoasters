All right. For this year, I took two different visits to SFMM again. And as always, I'm combinding the two into one update. Anyways, for one of those visits, I tried using the California Public Transportation System to get there to see how that is.

So far, it's not going so great. It's really not a good sign when you have to take 4 buses and a train to travel only 20 miles.

This place is lovely. It's simply a beautiful paradise. The only thing missing from this little peice of heaven is hypodermic needles, and then I'd want to live here for the rest of my life. *end sarcasm*

Ok, now here's what really sucks. Having your bus be late, which only gives you a few minutes to catch your train, however, to get on the train, you have to buy your ticket from this really confusing hard to use the person who designed this was totally drunk machine to get your ticket. I ended up having someone walk me through buying the ticket, WHILE THE F*CKING TRAIN WAS PULLING INTO THE STATION!!!! To make matters worse, after getting my ticket, I somehow dropped my wallet, because when I was about to board the train, I noticed it was gone, so in a mad panic attack, I ran to the machine and looked around on the floor for it, and probably looked like I was on crack while doing it. Then, luckily someone found it and asked if this was what I was looking for. Thank god the people there actually had a sense of morality and didn't just take all my stuff. So then, I grabbed my wallet, and made a mad dash to the train and just barely made it on. Yeah, I'm not taking California Public Transportation again.

Anyways, at SFMM. It appears Goliath is sponsered by these cars that I wish I had driven. (And I really don't like driving that much.)

</center>
<center>
You people riding Collosus forewords are coaster pansies!!! Grow some balls and do it backwards!!!! (This excludes kids too small for Backwards Collosus but tall enough for Regular Collosus.)
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Oh yeah, and sometimes, there would be Coaster Races between Forewords Collosus and Backwards Collosus. And they were awesome!!! =) Even if we did lose. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus53.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Now I know what you're thinking. "What a sh*tty photo. Why did you put it in the update?" Well, mostly because of that dot right there. That, if you didn't know, is actually the planet Jupiter. And yeah, it's freaking cool. Plus, how many people can say that they have Riddlers Revenge and the planet Jupiter in the same photo? Ok, that's enough of my astronomy dork side.

First off, we saw the Heckles & Twich Show. Personally, I kind of found it to have declined in quality this year. But still, it's Heckles & Twich. And they are awesome.
