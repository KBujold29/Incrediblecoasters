RCPro had at a Six Flags Magic Mtn meet up and since Cody is a member of RCPro, He took me. By the way, This Viper shot has nothing to do with the update.

Cody almost had  heart attack when paying to finally ride Thrill Shot. Or maybe he just had too much Mountain Dew this moring?

Personally, I wasn't a big fan of it. (Yes I rode it with him.) The launch was slow and the tilting was OK. I don't hate the ride, It's just not worth $15.00. But its still better than Dive Devil for $35.00!!!!

Since I stayed up all night playing Gears of War, I found the perfect ride to get my daily 3 min of sleep on.
