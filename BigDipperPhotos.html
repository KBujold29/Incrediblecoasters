Back during my visit to Geauga Lake, I almost never made it on Big Dipper. I just got on it during my final half hour. I got in the seats and we climbed up the lifthill.  Let me tell you this, when we dropped, we gained A LOT of speed. I can't really remember what happened after that. I just remember it being fast having a bunch of airtime and a really good handful of laterals in the middle of the ride. I did manage to take a POV of the ride, but since it was like 9:30 at night, nothing came out. I am really sad that Big Dipper had to close down. Aside from Dominator, it was the best ride in the park. Now back in 2010, some people ended up buying the Big Dipper and they want to re-build it. FANTASTIC!!! WAY TO GO GUYS!!! Unfortunetly, these people don't really have a plan, or any idea on how to relocate a coaster, or any money, or a place to build it. So yeah. The chances of this being re-built are about the same as my chance of being struck by a mega-cryometeor tomorrow at lunch. Especially since they spent more time screaming that they could at people who doubted them instead of solving any of these problems. I don't even think they're trying anymore. I don't think they own it anymore. Bummer as I actually liked this coaster. =(
