We're here at Särkänniemi. For today's ride, we'll be traveling back in time to review Trombi. This was the parks Zamperla Volare. I know these rides have a horrendous reputation in the roller coaster community. But I actually enjoyed the last couple Volares I rode (though to be fair, I rerode one of those, and it didn't age well). So I was hoping that this would continue that trend. So let's move on and ride. We walked up and saw the way you loaded. It's a very bizzare way to load. The cars are tilted and you simply climb in the cars and sort of stand up, only at a 45 degree angle. Then the ride operator pulled down the cage, locking you in. It felt very awkward to be in this position. Because as you can tell, it sort of felt like a prison when you are like this. After doing that, you then tilted into flying position. Then you went into the spiral lifthill. I have got to say that the spiral lifthill is one of the coolest lifthills on a rollercoaster. It just has a trippy and awkward feeling to it. But at the same time, it sort of has a feeling of impending doom to it. And considering the way Volares are treated within the roller coaster community, I'm sure a lot of enthusiasts get a sense of dread on these rides. Then, we reached the top. We went through an S Curve, and got a good view of Särkänniemi. But we were just thinking of the impending doom that we were about to go through. Down the first drop, it felt like we were going dangerously fast because right after this, we were about to go through one of those ridicously tight turns we have seen in the line. We embraced to be donkey-kicked in our skulls, and sadly, we got a decent smack. Now granted. This wasn't super bad. I can certainly think of worse rides. But considering how the last two volares I rode were actually kind of smooth, this was incredibly dissapointing. I hated that the enthusiasts compaining about Volares being rough were right in this case. Right after that, we went straight through an inline twist. And all I can say is this. Inline Twists on Volares are really fun. You get some crazy hang time as you suprisingly have enough room in your hamster cage to sort of float upsidedown and get some hangtime (Oh, and to those who don't consider inline twists on flying coasters to be inversions, I don't know what crack you are smoking, but I just have two things to say. #1: Stop smoking crack. It's not cool and it'll kill you. #2: Go ride a Volare and then you'll realize "Oh wait, I'm upsidedown"). Yeah, it was a bit more clunky on this one. But even on the really rough Volares, the inline twists are still fun. You then went through another tight turn before hitting a mid course brakes. OUCH!! GOD DAMN IT!!! STUPID HEADBANGING!!! We then dropped again before going through another tight turn, which gave us yet another SMACK!!! F*CK!!! We then were led into another inline twist. YAY!!! More Hangtime! And we're upsidedown! =) We then went through a tight turn, and OUCH!!! Why did this one have to suck!? =( This lead us into another set of mid course brakes. So basically, we did everything that we did before the mid course brakes. After these next mid course brakes, we then went down another small drop before going through another tight turn. DONKEY KICK!!! OUCH!!! So basically, the last third of the ride was just like the first two thirds without the inline twists, only replaced with twisty bits. And considering on this one, the inline twists were the only thing that was good about it at all, this was a problem. Then you got into the brakes. Aww man. Now I see why coaster enthusiasts hate Volares so much. On top of the headbanging, the whole ride is really repetitive. I mean, the first two halfs are exact clones of each other. I really wouldn't recommend this ride as yeah. It's pretty rough, the capacity isn't that good, and it just plain sucks. Yeah. I'm not missing this ride.
