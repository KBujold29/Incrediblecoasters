All right! I took my first visit to Wild Rivers in <a href="WildRivers07.html">2007</a> and I LOVED IT!!! It was scheduled to close after the 2007 season, but it still hasn't closed yet and since this place is awsome, I decided to go again in 2009. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildrivers3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. Incrediblecoasters has returned to Wild Rivers!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Since we're at Wild Rivers, why not start out on one of the badass slides they have at Wild Rivers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So for those who haven't read the <a href="WildRivers07.html">2007 Wild Rivers Update</a> and don't know about Bombay Blasters, Bombay Blasters is a slide that basically goes underground and then launches you into the water.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And then you splash down into the water.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And as you can see, you can fly out in many different ways.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Next up, Ghetto Bamboo Racers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfhill5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hope you're not to attached to those mats, cause they'll be flying away from you soon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfhill6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may be me, but it seemed like Surf Hill was better in 2007.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wahtubee3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wahtubee. Though it doesn't do too much, it's still a pretty cool slide.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wahtubee4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wahtubee Awsomeness!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="switzerfalls2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Switzer Falls is also a pretty cool slide they have here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="switzerfalls3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it's no Bombay Blasters, I still had alot of fun on it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wavepool.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Like all waterparks, Wild Rivers has a wavepool. And like most other water parks, it's nothing special.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boogieboarding.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They also had a new upcharge attraction where you can rent a boogie board and go boogie boarding.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonslide.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Grr!!! I'm the evil two headed Dragon Slide. While these kids slide down me, I'm planning the end of the world in 2012. Now gimme some candy!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterworks.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Water, Water, Everywhere theres water.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="abyss4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh Crap! Not this ride!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="abyss5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I didn't like this ride back in 2007 and I don't like it now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="abyss6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Actually it wasn't quite as bad as it was 2007.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="abyss7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You may not be as bad as you were in 2007, but you are still a very boring and s**tty waterslide.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="liquidator3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, we get to look at the infamous Liquidator.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="liquidator4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hi, I'm the Liquidator. I don't know where you heard this crap about me being dangerous, but I want to tell you all that it's not true! I deserve to be open!!! For Gods sake, I was on Malcom in the Middle!!! Isn't that reason enough to open me up?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="liquidator5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well for all those who wish to climb up the Liquidator, nows your chance.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowlspatriotentrance2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next would be Bazooka Bowls and Patriot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheelIRVINE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While waiting in line for Patriot, you can get a good view of this ferris wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="patriot3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Patriot. It's a very intersting slide.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="patriot4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not these turns that make it interesting.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="patriot5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's this half pipe at the end of the ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ladies and gentelmen, I'd like to present to you, the REAL helix of death.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Such a powerful helix.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You don't know what a backscratching waterslide is until you've gone on Bazooka Bowls. (Or at least a clone of it.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Between marathoning Bazooka Bowls and not putting sunscreen on my back, my back was not happy with me today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When Bazooka Bowls is tired of putting you through the helix of death, it simply flushes you away.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bazookabowls12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fatty got flushed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grafitti.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not cool. Bazooka Bowls is way too good for Grafitti. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Luckily Wild Rivers unlike another certain Socal Waterpark still has their tube chute ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Congo River Rapids was hauling ass today!!! I ended up falling out of the tube, kicked Cody in the face, and scratched my back in the process!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Alot of people rode Congo River Rapids in many interesting positions this year.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First up, we've got Mr. "I'm too cool for my tube, so I'm ditching it" Dude.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up, we've got Mr. "Just Chillaxing on Congo River Rapids" Dude.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="congoriverrapids11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And finally, we've got Beavis and Butthead blocking the slide while they do some idiotic wrestling.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chaos3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Chaos. It was no fun in 2007.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chaos4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
2009 was no different.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Back to Bombay Blasters and it's awsomeness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While I love Bombay Blasters, I was dissapointed that they were only running one side of it today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters13.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. You'll be flying out of here in no time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombayblasters14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bombay Blasters in all it's awsomeness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildrivers2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And that concludes our Wild Rivers Update in 2009. Wild Rivers is an awsome waterpark. So if you live in Southern California, come to Wild Rivers instead of Raging Waters. We know you'll love it.
