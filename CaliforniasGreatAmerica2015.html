All right. Time for another update. And it's time for a fairly large update. For a while now, I've been saying that I need to get up to Northern California and do a Nor-Cal trip. However, that trip got postponed and postponed until eventually, I just decided to split the initial trip into multiple day trips. I already had gone to <a href="SixFlagsDiscovoryKingdom2014.html">Six Flags Discovory Kingdom</a> back at Christmas Time for Superman: Ultimate Flight. And now today, I'm off at California's Great America to get on Gold Striker.

</center>
<center>
It's about damn time I got on this GCI.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I am happy to say that this ride exceeded my expectations and is my new favorite GCI.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. This ride is better than the almighty Prowler. Suck it!! =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That covered first drop may be small, but man does it give riders just a TON of speed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. Gold Striker is just a GREAT GCI. It's fast, has lots of laterals and changes in directions, and even a couple good pops of airtime. It just runs like a bat out of hell and is a fantastic ride. Easily the best wooden coaster in all of California. =)

<img src="fountain27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Look at the pretty fountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="topgun22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's move onto the other great ride in the park. Top Gun. Let's marathon!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="topgun23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, I may not be a fan of the cherry red color scheme, but it's still one of the stronger and better B&M Inverts, packing a powerful punch to this day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="topgun24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Ariel view of Top Gun. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flyingeagles2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Flyers + Windy Day = A lot of fun.
</center>

<p>

<center>
Surprisingly, the enterprise here was actually run really well. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="firefall.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Rode this Top Spin at <a href="ThrillCoastersGeaugaLake.html">Geauga Lake</a> and it sucked there. What would make it better here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="delarium4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is it me or did this frisbee get much weaker over the years?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="lucyscrabbiecabbies.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The only credit in the park I don't have. And knowing the restrictions, it's going to remain that way. I may be a whore, but I'm not THAT big a whore.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign378.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Am I the only weirded out that they used red for being OK to ride and blue for being too small. I just feel like they don't understand basic color psycology here. Even kindergardeners know that red means stop and green means go.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dropzone8.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Still a big fan of these Intamin 2nd Generation Drop Towers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="grizzlyPGA8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did you seriously think that I would ride something that's been in my <a href="Top10WorstCoasters.html">Top 10 Worst Coasters List</a> for years now? No! F*ck Grizzly!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="demon5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, at least Demon was running really well. Much smoother and faster than I initially remembered.
</center>

<p>

<center>
Congrats on 40 seasons.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="vortexPGA10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What haven't we ridden yet? Oh yeah. Vortex.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="vortexline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did somebody say that the line for Vortex in the middle of the day was hell? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="vortexPGA11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may be my least favorite B&M, but I still enjoy it to a certain extent.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="invertigograve.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey! Let's go ride Inverti--Oh F*ck!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="psychomouseline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELL NO!!! NOT WORTH THE WAIT!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="centrifugeline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I think the park is littered with a ton of small kids cause all the thrill rides are walk ons, but the family rides all have ridicolous waits.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's get some more Gold Striker rides! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love this ride. I really do.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldstriker11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Crap. Gold Strikers 10-7. We won't be able to ride it for a while.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="santacruzbeachboardwalkentrance3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we did everything we wanted at California's Great America. So we decided to head on over to the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk cause just like all the other Nor-Cal parks, it had new credits for me to get and I was overdue for them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds66.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn. California's Great America may have been relatively empty (at least at the rides worth riding), the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is PACKED!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantdipperSCBB13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not be as good as Gold Striker this morning, but I still really like the Santa Cruz Giant Dipper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="picture78.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. The Santa Cruz Giant Dipper has a real impressive history and I'm happy it's been standing all this time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="undertowSCBB.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now it's time for another new credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="undertowSCBB2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Maybe I just hit it on a bad day, but this thing BARELY spun. AT ALL!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="undertowSCBB3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh well, I'll be riding Spider, which is a much better clone of this in a month. So hey. It's all good. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="seaserpentSCBB.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh boy!! You know what this means!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="seaserpentSCBB2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. After multiple visits and always being closed, I'm finally able to get this damn kiddy credit. And to be fair, it's one of the better kiddy coasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rockoplaneSCBB.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We still have 4 tickets left, enough to get a ride on the Rock O Plane, which can I say was running fantastic. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="doughnuts10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why is it that I didn't see any Texas Doughnuts back when I was in Texas?
</center>


<p>
<center>
<img src="arcade8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. I've never looked inside their arcade. And I must say, I really like the look of this place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ashtray2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On our way out, some random dude came up to us and gave us both free ash trays. This is completely useless since neither of us smoke, but...thanks. I guess. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="santacruzbeachboardwalkentrance4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And that was our Nor-Cal day. I was greatly impressed with this day and that I not only knocked Gold Striker out of the way and struck gold with that, but also cleaned up the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and got all that I needed there. Seriously, all I need is Gilroy Gardens and I'll be done with Northern California. I had a blast and really enjoyed both California's Great America and the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and am hoping to have much more fun up in Northern California.
