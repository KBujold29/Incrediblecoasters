Ok. So you've probably been wondering "Why hasn't Incrediblecoasters gone to SFMM yet?" Well, we at Incrediblecoasters didn't want to create a bunch of updates for every insignificant visit to SFMM we took over the summer. So we decided that it would be best to just combinde all of our summer updates into one big update. Anyways, onto Visit #1. We are currently standing in line to buy two of Cody's friends their tickets since the Free Friend Coupon expired.

"DAMN YOU STUPID EXPIRED COUPON!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream75.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First ride of the day, Scream Marathon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wendys5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for lunch at Wendys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wendys6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As if those fries didn't already have enough salt on them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninja31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, more Ninja goodness. (Oh yeah. the Karate Kid wraps are now gone!!!!) =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninja32.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We ended up getting stuck on Ninja's Lifthill. (The other one.) It wasn't fun. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstream9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet. I could use a good water ride right now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstream10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not a big water ride person, but they are great on days like this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator54.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. I didn't want to get that wet. Better ride Terminator to dry off.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator55.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. Terminator's audio is officially gone. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="studio6F2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On the brightside, Studio 6F opened.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="studio6F3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So far, this doesn't seem like a very Incrediblecoasters friendly place. Just a bunch of clothes.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="studio6F4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. That's better, A place to relax. Much more Incrediblecoasters friendly.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="freestylecoke.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But the highlight of Studio 6F, and the crowning achievement of all that Six Flags has done for SFMM in 2010 is without a doubt, the Freestyle Coke Machine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="freestylecoke2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think I have fallen in love.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="freestylecoke3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In my hand, I hold Grape Vault. And it kicks major ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign126.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I know that's you Original X on the sign.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X75.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we went on X2. For obvious reasons.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X2GumSupport2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only does SFMM now have a Freestyle Coke Machine, but they also got a new Freestyle Gum Support for X2.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X76.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
X2 broke down on us. God Damn!!! That's two rides I got stuck on in one day. I think we're cursed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viper54.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hows it going Six Flags Great Adventure fanboys?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Revolution has now become "Grown Ups. The Ride."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It actually looked like a good movie. (I was going to see it, but I ended up watching Toy Story 3 instead.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="logjammer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You people may have soaked me with those water cannons, but at least you didn't flip me off and throw Powerade at me. *cough* Mr. Road Rage Asshole. *cough*
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roadrageasshole.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Speaking of Mr. Road Rage Asshole, I have to tell you the story. Basically, I was driving to Six Flags Magic Mountain, and I was driving in the slow lane. Now I don't speed (at least I didn't back in 2010), and this insane guy going 90 mph nearly rear ends me. Goes around me, flips me off and throws a bottle of Powerade at my car before going back to driving 100 mph and completely vanishing. Uhh...All I have to say is "F*ck you and I hope you got a big fat EXPENSIVE speeding ticket as well as a ticket for littering.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliathline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Visit #2. Up next, how about a Goliath Marathon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath75.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've really been loving Goliath recently. It's just sort of grown on me this summer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time to go back to my old ways and soak myself on Tidal Wave's Bridge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, I just wait for the water to come.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="freestylecoke4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Today's choice of beverage would be Peach Sprite.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X77.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Another day at SFMM, another ride on X2.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X78.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
X2 kicked my ass. And I loved every second of it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sfmmview6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Artsy shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="receipt2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
More Incrediblecoasters news. The front of these reciepts always turns brown. Even if the reciept is facing with it's back to the sun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="santapaulafair.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, so I was REALLY bored one day and heard there was a fair just in Santa Paula, and I figured I go on over there. (I'm including this in the update because I want to share this story on Incrediblecoasters, but don't want to create a whole update for it and figured it would fit in with the rest of this update.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="santapaulafair2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, the Santa Paula Fair SUCKED!!!!! COMPLETE WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="santapaulafair3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You see that Rock-O-Plane in the background, that was the ONLY ride I rode that day. And I paid $14.00 for it. NOT WORTH IT!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Visit #3. This visit SUCKED because as you can see, it was PACKED today!!!! It was about as bad as <a href="SixFlagsMagicMtnSummer09.html">last year.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tram2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Skittles Tram!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape26.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I keep hearing rumors that Superman's gonna have a big makeover. Is this true?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge96.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well at least there is some good news about this visit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign127.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge97.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Single Riders Riddlers Revenge Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="longhornBBQ6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, at least Longhorns doesn't have a long line. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="freestylecoke5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Boo to the Freestyle Coke Machine being down. Because of that, I had to get my soda from the Soda Shack, which sucked. Warning, Long Incrediblecoasters Rant down below.
</center>

<p>
<p>
<p>
<center>
IT DOES NOT TAKE 10 MINUTES TO ORDER A DRINK!!!! I ONLY HAD TWO GROUPS AHEAD OF ME!!! BUT IT WAS STILL A 20 MINUTE WAIT!!! I SWEAR TO GOD!!!! ARE PEOPLE THIS STUPID ABOUT MAKING A SIMPLE CHOICE!!!! THE PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME WERE ACTING LIKE THIS!!!!! "Mom, I want a Coke." "No Timmy, that has caffine in it. Get a Powerade." "But I don't want a powerade Mom. I want a Coke." "But Timmy, that has caffine. Powerade doesn't even have carbonation in it." Fast foreword a longass time. "Ok. That'll be $12.99. Oh. Honey, should we pay the man with a ten dollar bill and three ones?" "Actually, I feel like giving him two 5s and three 1s." "Bob, I really think we should use a ten because...Blah Blah Blah Blah." Fast foreword a longass time. "I need my money." "Huh?" "I need the money for those drinks." "Oh yeah." JUST PICK A F*CKING BEVERAGE AND STOP WASTING MY LIFE!!!!!!! IF YOU REGRET YOUR BEVERAGE CHOICE, IT'S NOT THE END OF THE F*CKING WORLD!!! JUST GO BUY ANOTHER ONE, OR JUST WAIT TILL YOU GET HOME AND THEN GO TO VONS AND BUY A TWELVE PACK OF IT THERE!!! JUST SHUT THE F*CK UP, PAY UP, AND STOP WASTING MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!! (You don't know how hard it was to not scream this at those people.)

<center>
"Hey Gertrude! How's it going?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Allie still hadn't been on Terminator, so we had to go do that for her.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator57.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hmm. Does this go to anything?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator58.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ok, I know I'm a Terminator Virgin and all, but does that really happen to my face during the experience?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Even X2 was beyond our limit. (And we have a VERY high limit for X2. 2 hours. That's a lot longer than most rides.) And if X2 is beyond our limits, then that's the signal to GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think I just vomited with disgust.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only is it crowded beyond belief, but the crowds are STILL GROWING!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well today sucked.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="blacksnakesummit10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like Hurricane Harbor is just as disgustingly packed as Six Flags Magic Mountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you think you're going to have fun with crowds of this size, you better either get a Gold Q Bot or get yourself checked to see if you're mentaly retarded.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you look closely, you can see that the OVERFLOW PARKING LOT IS FULL!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="temperature.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To make this worse, it was boiling out today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Visit #4. Looks like it's true. Superman is down until Late 2011 for a big makeover.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape28.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
This better be good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream76.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For some reason, Scream NEVER has a long line. It can be packed, and Scream will still be empty.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath76.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For some idiotic reason, we got in line for Goliath, KNOWING that it was broken down, and waited an hour and a half for it to open until we just left. I never even saw it run at all today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. Time for some credit whoring.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I feel sadder and more pathetic with each ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. You may be from Australia, but that doesn't mean you should go out and start being a credit whore.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Revolution has converted itself into "The other Guys. The Ride."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="revolution26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Revolution wasn't running that well today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viper55.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. I've got some good news and some bad news about Viper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign128.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news. Viper now has a Single Riders Line!!!! YAY!!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viper56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The bad news. Hair Gel is back. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tatsu58.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Tatsu was indeed our final ride of the final visit of the update.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tatsu57.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, it was interesting summer with good visits to SFMM, bad visits to SFMM, and a crappy fair.
