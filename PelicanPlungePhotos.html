We're here at New Wild Rivers, and we're here to ride their star water slide. Pelican Plunge. This is the parks water coaster. And....HOLY CRAP!!! THIS IS A GOOD ONE!!! No really! This is one of the best water coasters that I've ridden! The only ones I've ridden that are better are <a href="WildebeestPhotos.html">Wildebeest</a> and <a href="MammothPhotos.html">Mammoth</a>, both at Splashin Safari within Holiday World. And those are the best water coasters. So to have this one be within striking distance, is really saying something! All right. Grab the tub, up the stairs, and we're off! We head down a big drop, gaining quite a bit of speed. WEE!!! We then rise up a big hill. Seriously. This is pretty big by water coaster standards. Go into another tube and around a turn. Wait a minute. We're gaining speed here! Go around another turn, and....still gaining speed! This is practically two partial helixes. And we're about to pop out of the tube and down another drop! WEE!!! DAMN!!! THIS IS REALLY GOOD!!! Go up another small hill, and into another tube. This leads to another turn. And I think it's slightly downhill as we're gaining speed! We pop out of the tube and go through a little speedbump hill. BOOM!!! WATER SLIDE AIRTIME!!! WEE!!! Back into a tube. I see the light. We should be popping out soon. WHOA!!! Now this is where Pelican Plunge really shines and features the highlight of the ride. A small little halfpipe. And we're going FAST!!! So this just leads to us getting some crazy swinging action! From here, we just have some straight track to the pool. But don't underestimate this part of the ride! The swinging action we got from the halfpipe is giving some crazy rocking action that makes us rock up the walls. It seriously feels like we're going to fly off the slide! And into the pool! HOLY CRAP!!! THIS SLIDE IS SO F*CKING GOOD!!! THE ONLY REASON WILDEBEEST IS BETTER IS THAT THIS IS SADLY A SHORT SLIDE!!! EASILY A <a href="Top10WaterSlides.html">TOP 10 WATER SLIDE!!!</a> If this ride was double the lenght, it truly would be one of the best water slides that REALLY would stand out. DO NOT SKIP THIS RIDE IF YOU'RE AT NEW WILD RIVERS!!!
