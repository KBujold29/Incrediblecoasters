Well, we were originally planning on hitting Knotts Berry Farm in July when Windseeker was open, but after Cody and Ceaser went on Bert the Conquerer, they got free tickets to Knotts, and I got Ceaser's ticket since he has a season pass. Well, it turned out that the tickets expired on July 1, so going in July wasn't gonna happen, so we moved our Summer Knotts Visit to June. Anyways, to our dismay, lots and lots of schoolkids were here today, which did not make us happy, especially after sitting through much worse than normal L.A Traffic.

</center>
<center>
Well, Xcelerator may be closed, but at least Boomerang doesn't have a line.
</center>

<center>
Ugh. It really wasn't running well today. =(
</center>

<p>

  <img src="boomerang17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! Perilous Plunge is open and has no line!!!!!! 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
I don't care if it is cold (not really) and cloudy. Perilous Plunge kicks ass and totally deserves its spot on the <a href="Top10WaterRides.html">Top 10 Water Rides List!!!!!</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ponyexpress12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. We really are that desperate to find a ride with a short line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ponyexpress13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, I think this was the best I've ever seen Pony Express run. Ever. There were a few laterals, some mild speed, and I was actually smiling.

I think I found out where all the schoolkids are coming from!!!

Since Knotts has untolerable <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/sign168.JPG">food prices</a> outside Mrs. Knotts, we headed over to the local McDonalds for lunch. Glad we did since we met up with some cool people who I'll be seeing later this summer on the Northeast Trip.

<center>
Man, if it weren't for those f*cking brakes on the turnaround, Ghostrider would be running great.

Cody: "Yeah. You're a dumbass for not riding this till now. Ride it more often."
</center>
<center>
Ceaser: "What the f*ck are you talking about? This ride is lame. I wanna get on Xcelerator."

"Oh man. I gotta take a piss. Hmm. We keep saying we need more rain in California. Perhaps I could help out CA in this rain problem. And the car down below needs to be washed anyway."
