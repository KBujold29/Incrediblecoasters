</center>
<center>
All right. After our fun at Skara Sommerland, we actually ended up going to Grona Lund for more fun, and yeah. We have arrived in Stockholm.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stockholm2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Very pretty view of Stockholm's Old Town.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stockholm3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know a lot of my non-coaster friends are displeased that I was in Stockholm and didn't go explore it in detail like I did with Copenhagen and Helsinki. Sorry, I'm sure I'll be back in Stockholm fairly soon and check it out then.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There was a bit of a f*ck up in our hotel rooms as none of them were able to be opened. Bummer, but at least it's all fine now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gronalund.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now it's time to head on over to Grona Lund.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="presentation11.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were greeted to Grona Lund by the park president with a nice presentation, dinner, and...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poncho.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These complementary ponchos for the bad weather. Yeah, I should point out right now that we have been INCREDIBLY lucky when it comes to weather on this trip. I mean, this is Scandinavia, where it frequently rains A LOT. And yet, this is the first time on the trip where we've had to deal with rain, and considering how this is Day 12, that's amazing!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and I loved the dinner. Yes, there has been great food all over this trip, but this dinner was a personal favorite of mine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="radiobilarna.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to move on and explore the park, and no, we did not do the bumper cars tonight.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lustigahuset.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nah. Let's start out with the fun house. Probably not a smart idea because with the difficult nature of this one and the handles being wet and slippery from the rain, I was genuinely worried that I'd slip and fall for a split second (FYI, I AM using both hands. This was shot with a GoPro).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lustigahuset2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Trippy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lustigahuset3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Jane!! Stop this crazy thing!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. That was fun, but let's get these credits out of the way. And yep, it's time for INSANE!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It feels so good to be riding Un-neutered Green Lantern again, oh wait. Even that wasn't as good as this. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let me put it this way. At it's WORST, Insane is on par with Green Lantern at it's VERY BEST, right when it first opened and before Six Flags got their dirty hands on it and f*cked it up. Don't even get me started on the way Insane is when run for special events.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insaneline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And overall, I just love the theme of Insane. It's simple, but effective. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insaneline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't feel bad random Swedish woman. I made that exact same face when I saw what Six Flags Magic Mountain did to Green Lantern.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We really need more classic Schwarzkophs like this running.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildamusen.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and their Wild Mouse is AMAZING!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildamusen2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, it's technically not a Wild Mouse, so I can't list it as my favorite, but I love it nonetheless.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="twisterGRONA.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not be Balder from yesterday, but I still thouroughly enjoyed Twister. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kvasten.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Got the Kvasten credit, and yeah. It's a nice fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spokhusen.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Much like Liseberg, Grona Lund has an all year round Horror Maze, and it's normally an upcharge, but we didn't have to pay. Tack Grona Lund.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spokhusen2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not be the best, but it still beats everything at Fright Fest.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nyckelpigan.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now it's time for the credit whoring to really begin.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nyckelpigan2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this ride may not be thrilling at all. But it did something that no other ride was able to do so far.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nyckelpigan3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It made Nolan lose his still camera. Yes, while other people lose their cameras to rides like <a href="Fall2009PhotosKBF.html">Silver Bullet</a>, Nolan lost his still camera to this itty bitty kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nyckelpigan4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It still baffles me how something like this would have the laterals to throw a camera out of ones pocket. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="veteranbilarnia.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No, I'm not just goofing off. I'm checking to see if I can find Nolan's still camera. No luck so far."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tufftufftaget.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one last credit and then I'm all done.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tufftufftaget2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay!! I got the (barely counts as a) credit!! And nobody lost their still camera or $900 sunglasses on it either. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="karlekstunneln.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, we rode this kiddy log flume. And yes, we fit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="karlekstunneln2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Entering the tunnel of love.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="karlekstunneln3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, so love is jesting for a king at axe point. Sorry Disney movies, you got it all wrong.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frittfall.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
The stand up floorless side may be closed due to winds, but we were still able to the normal side of their drop tower.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey American Parks!! We were able to get all the credits here and do other fun things such as the fun house, drop tower, and tunnel of love dark ride all during a rainstorm over here in Sweden. What's your excuse?" =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="heater.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you're wondering why we're all huddled over here. Well, because there's a heater here, and...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pizza2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There's free pizza and beer over here. You wouldn't want to leave if there was free pizza and beer over here? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. During ERT, we had perhaps the craziest thing ever!! The Insane Water Challenge!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Some people managed to actually keep water despite the crazy flipping (it's called cheating). My personal favorite was watching Neil come into the brake run with a full cup of water. Then in smugness, lifted his hand from the top (told you it was via cheating) and then they flipped and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo">he lost ALL the water. =) </a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for the next day of the trip. First up, a LOT of ERT and throughout it all, we had groups of people climbing the Starflyer (but we'll take about that later).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let's get ERT started with some good old Schwarzkoph action.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really hope that it's clone in England finds a home, cause this ride is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's just a hot twisted mess. And yes, this drop is as good as it looks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Jetline vs Vilden Mausen!!! FIGHT!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="twisterGRONA2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right, now let's get some more rides on Twister since I only got one yesterday.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="twisterGRONA4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Twister may not be Top 10 worthy or amazing, but much like Wooden Warrior in the U.S.A, it packs a powerful punch in a small space.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="twisterGRONA3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's got some really nice airtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="twisterGRONA5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And some really nice laterals as yeah, Twister is indeed, very twisted.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="concert.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure who exactly was performing during ERT, but I really liked their performance.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kvasten2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, why not take a 2nd ride on Kvasten while it's open.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kvasten3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kvasten isn't like the normal kiddy SLCs, as this one has a custom layout and is much more enjoyable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kvasten4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Plus it's themed to flying witches and located at Grona Lund. That also significantly helps its cause. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="frittfall2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and the stand up floorless side of the drop tower is now open. And considering how much better these things are standing up with no floor, this is easily one of the <a href="Top10DropTowers.html">best drop towers I've ever ridden</a>. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, now it's time for me to climb up to the top of the Star Flyer. Now some of you may be wondering "Why the hell would they allow a guy who has a tendency to jump off cliffs to the top of a 400 ft Star Flyer?" Well, as some of you know, Coastin for Kids, has been big at Cedar Fair parks for a while now as a way to funraise to Give Kids the World to help kids with cancer. Well Grona Lund wanted to help, so they made an offer. Host an auction and the top 20 fundraisers will go up to the top of the Star Flyer. I participated, but due to my hatred of auctions (F*CK EBAY!) and me watching my wallet due to my INSANE budget to fundraise for 2015, I didn't get in. Not surprising. But then Grona Lund expanded on that offer to raise more money for Coastin for Kids. So anyone who donates $200 will be able to climb up to the top. This caught my attention and really tempted me. I really want to do this, but I'm on a nightmare suffocatingly tight budget. Can I pull this off? I was on the verge of declining, but then I thought. I probably will never have another oppertunity to go up to the top of a star flyer. Think of all the shots I can get. Think how much better my Grona Lund video will be with all those angles. Think of the experience. Screw it, it's an investment in photography and I made the donation. So now I get all these awesome shots, a great experience, more money goes to kids with cancer, and I can write this off on my 2015 taxes. It's a win win scenario for everyone.  
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First things first, you have to climb up 25 ft to get to the 2nd ride up.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But don't expect that part to be a cakewalk. You have to essentially just hold on to nothing has you ride on up to the top, where you have another ladder to climb up. This part personally was not a favorite of mine, not because I'm afraid of heights (Remember, I jump off cliffs), mostly because I'm a kind of guy who likes to lean back, so I was constantly reminded that I'm barely strapped in and am nearly tilting to my death, so it was an uncomfortably straight ride to the top (Thank god for photography to occupy me).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="insane6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Insane is so good. Can I just have this and never ride Green Lantern again?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You gotta admit. These Jetline shots are AMAZING!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetline6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just checking to make sure nobody is climbing up the lifthill. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>

<center>
See if you can spot the TPR members in this photo.
</center>

<p>

  <img src="frittfall3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love the "OH SH*T!!!" look on their faces.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay!!! We made it to the machine room and just have one ladder to go until we reach the ball at the top.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I did it!!! I climbed to the top of this Star Flyer!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, that is corret. I am standing up at the top of the sphere at the top of one of the worlds tallest Star Flyers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stockholm5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And just as I expected, the view of Stockholm is just absolutely beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stockholm4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cliff Jump!!!
</center>

"Hey Six Flags Over Texas!!! Suck it!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipseGRONA9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Still hard to belive I just climbed a star flyer on this day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch40.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tried out one of the Thai places for lunch, and I must admit. It's really good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildamusen3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Had to get another ride on Vilda Musen because...I just love this ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildamusen4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nice airtime, nice laterals, great setting, just an overall pleasent family coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildamusen5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I particuarlly like the way it just snakes its way through Jetline and over Grona Lund. These Gerstlauter Bobsleds need to come to America ASAP.
</center>

</center>
<center>
Well Stockholm, ♫ It's been fun, but now I've got to go. Life is way too short to take it slow. ♫ Seriously, Stockholm looks like an awesome city and Grona Lund is amazing. When Can I See You Again?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign344.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for us to head onto the Overnight Ferry to Helsinki. Sorry Tallinn, maybe next time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="overnightferry.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This isn't our ship. Our ship is much bigger than this.

</center>
<center>
I love this. Not only was check in very pleasent, but I love how they have these machines that let you grade the experience. This needs to come to all Six Flags parks immidietly. Well, you got a green smiley face from me. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="overnightferry2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and there's our rooms. I'll see you at 3:00 AM.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="overnightferry3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This is less like a typical ferry and more like a cruise ship. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture69.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Black Sheep with a beer. Yeah, that seems like me all right.
</center>

<p>

Whenever the oppertunity to eat dinner with chopsticks is avaliable, always take it.

</center>
<center>
Love the unlimited desserts on the ship.

Dude!! They have Crispy M&Ms over here!!! This is simply awesome!!! For those who don't know, Crispy M&Ms used to be a flavor back in the late 90s and they were one of my favorite kinds of M&Ms, but they discontinued them in the early 2000s. Or so I thought. They've been here in Europe this entire time!! MUST BUY!!!!

Of course, you knew Karaoke wouldn't be complete without Mr. Big Spender Ross getting up on stage.

After karaoke, it was just dancing on the dance floor all night. And yeah, I had a drunken blast.
