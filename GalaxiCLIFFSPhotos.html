For today's review, we are at Cliff's Amusement Park, and reviewing their other coaster. Galaxi. Now for most people, this looks like nothing special. I mean, come on. Its a freaking Galaxi. This is a carnival coaster (then again, Cliffs is kind of like a giant carnival with a fantastic wooden coaster)! Just get the damn credit and lets do something else (New Mexico Rattler). So you hop in the cars, buckle your seatbelt, and you're off!!! You slowly roll around a turn and head up the lifthill. After you climb up the lifthill, you go around another slow turn. Then you head down the first drop. In the front, its just a fun first drop, but in the back, there's actually a decent moment of airtime. We then rise up a hill before we roll through another turn. We get a great view of....some other rides? Sand? Albuquerque? Nothing. The views suck here. We then drop back down another drop. We gain some more speed and go right under the first drop, which actually gave us a nice headchopper effect before we rise up a small hill where there's a tiny pop of airtime. Yeah. This is a middle of the road Galaxi. We then through a double helix. There's nothing particuarly exciting about this part of the ride. It doesn't gain much speed or have many laterals, but its sort of.....what makes a Galaxi....a Galaxi. So do the rowing gag and have some fun here. We then rise up a small little hill, but unfortunetly, theres a nasty trim here. LAME!!! We go through a small dip before rolling through another double helix. This one isn't nearly as fun as we start off much slower. But it's still fun. After gaining some speed from the double helix, we go through a slight turn, go through a dip, and go around a turn and get some laterals before rolling into the final brakes. While not one of the best rides ever, it's still a fun little ride. Yeah. It may be a carnival coaster. But it's still pretty fun. And hey, with so many Galaxis starting to close, it might actually become notable in the future due to rarity points if the rate of Galaxi closures keeps up.
