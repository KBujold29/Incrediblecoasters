Well, October has come once again, and as always, it's time for our Fall "Insert Year Here" Photos Update. This year, we'll be starting at Six Flags Magic Mountain for some seriously awesome fun, oh and as always, it's two October Visits in one update (Looking foreword to riding you Lex Luthor).

<center>
All right. Lets start off with a typical front row morning ride on Goliath.
</center>

"Dammit!!! I thought I'd promised I would stop doing this type of stuff at SFMM!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Damn!! Only 5 minutes!!! Something tells me that sign isn't so accurate.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
And apparently the park thought so too since on our 2nd Visit, it was posted as an hour.
</center>

</center>
<center>
While Batman the Ride was running <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/batmantheride69.JPG">WCB Style</a> with lights and fog, it was much weaker than it was at Westcoast Bash and the line was huge, so we only got on during the day.
</center>

</center>
<center>
*sigh* Wake me up when its time for Westcoast Bash 2012.
</center>

We also took a spin on Terminator/Apocolypse/SFMM's GCI for some GCI goodness.

Unfortunetly, this was the last time we ever got on Log Jammer as it closed the next day. =( I knew this months ahead due to working at the park, but yeah. It's still really sad since it was a really good log flume. But more fun, was <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLLzc0tb0Lw">soaking people on Log Jammer.</a> That was hilarious. Especially soaking Pink Sweater Girl, who you can see getting soaked <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gqqp5T763U">here.</a>

</center>
<center>
Why did I include this building in the update? No real reason. It just looks cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="johnnyrockets5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to go have lunch at Johnny Rockets for a change. Yeah, we had a good meal.
</center>

</center>
<center>
When we saw that the circus was in town, we just had to stop by.

</center>
<center>
We decided to take another spin on the Valencia Carousel. Why? We're f*cking insane. That's why.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mallcarousel5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Think the teacup on this carousel can't spin? Watch our <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-1TR43QuO0">video of us on it</a> here and then see just how much it can spin.

</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, the special Area 19 soundtrack wasn't working. =( That was a real bummer since that's much better than the normal soundtrack. But oh well. It's still X2.

<p>
<center>
<img src="viper61.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it may have been rough, Viper was hauling ass today!!! It simply whipped through all the loops and never slowed down!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign212.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dear Six Flags, when you notify of a single riders line, please actually HAVE IT!!! Or at least take down the sign if you won't put in the Single Riders Line.

"But if its ready to eat, why isn't you washed it? And if it's not washed, it's not ready to eat. You fail Gas Station. You fail big time."

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="collosus64.JPG" width="640" height="623" />
</center>
<center>
It's amazing how simply facing the other way can make the ride so much better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="collosus65.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah!! This is just as epic as you would suspect it is!!

<p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="frightfest14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was one of the new mazes. It was cool since it had fire, but Jokers Hideout is still better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds41.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You can tell it was a new maze since the line for it was ridicolous!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="riddlersrevenge106.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Riddlers Revenge was hauling so much ass, its got motion blur!!! Ok, that's from me not using a flash, but it was seriously hauling both nights we were at Fright Fest.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="frightfest15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Dammit!!! Who bled all over the path!!! Now we have to call first aid and the janitor!! Glad I'm not working tonight."

"Why Ms. Fright Fest Monster, I'd say you were trying to seduce me."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ninja33.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
