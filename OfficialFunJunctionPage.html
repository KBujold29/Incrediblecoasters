Fun Spot Atlanta is out of every park I have ever visited, THIS is the park that has changed the most (excluding the parks that died and transformed from themselves and transformed into either a parking lot or condos. But I don't count those). Cause when I first visited this park, it was called Fun Junction U.S.A. And it was PRIMARILY a credit whoring spot. I was in and out in 10 minutes and compared the park to an abandoned park you'd find in a Scooby Doo episode. I honestly NEVER thought I'd be back at this park. But when you compare the park to how it is now.....yeah. I'm for sure coming back here when I come back to Georgia. Why? Well, first of all, the park was bought out by Fun Spot. And they really put a ton of love into this park. They added a lot more rides and really cleaned the place up. That's great and all. But then....they did something unbelievable. They added an RMC. And not just a small little RMC to make their Family Entertainment Center stand out. They didn't order one of those new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGzE7cfqB3o">Wild Moose</a> coasters that they just announced last year (Really hope some small park builds one of those. They look like great family coasters). That'd be badass, but still believable. Even when you imagine a Family Entertainment Center going for a major badass coaster, you'd probably picture them adding either a Eurofighter or a Premier Sky Rocket II. But nope! This park said "F*CK IT!!!" and not only built an RMC, but a completely custom MASSIVE RMC that beats out the RMC at neighboring <a href="OfficialSixFlagsOverGeorgiaPage.html">Six Flags Over Georgia</a> and gets AMAZING REVIEWS!!! HOLY SH*T!!! THAT LOOKS LIKE ONE OF THE BEST COASTERS IN AMERICA!!! BUILT AT THIS SMALL LITTLE DINKY FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT CENTER THAT I SPENT LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AT AND NEVER THOUGHT I'D EVER RETURN TO!!!? HOLY SH*T!!! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED IN MAKING SURE KEVIN COMES BACK NEXT TIME HE'S IN GEORGIA!!!

All right. Here are all of the flat rides that are found at Fun Spot Atlanta. Now I didn't ride any of these. But they do seem to have a couple fun flat rides. When they were Fun Junction USA, they had a Screamin Swing. One of those single park ones with low capacity. They also seem to had a spider, as well as some kiddy flats. Since becoming Fun Spot Atlanta, they added several more flat rides. They now also have a music express, a paratrooper, a scrambler, a ferris wheel, and a carousel, Still nothing special. But I'm happy they're investing in the park and treating it well.

There is only one water ride at Fun Spot Atlanta. The Bumper Boats. Yep, these things tend to be a staple at small little parks like this. They can be fun if you go in a big group and just go all out. But credit whores probably don't want to get wet.

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Fun Spot Atlanta. Actually, from looking around the park, there are some other things worth talking about. Not theming. There's literally none. At most, they may have gotten to be on par with your typical carnival. All the rides are just plopped down. So ignore the theming part. Let's talk about other stuff. Because there's one particular thing worth mentioning. The Zipline. This place has a freaking Zipline. One those ziplines that seems similar to the one at the <a href="OfficialGlenwoodCavernsAdventureParkPage.html">Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park</a>. Sure, it doesn't go down a mountain here. But that's totally a cool thing to do. I kind of regret not checking it out. Those things are really cool. Aside from that...they have a slide. Those are fun. Oh, and Go Karts. These types of places always have Go Karts. Those fun, as always. Typical small park stuff.

Fun Spot Atlanta looks to be a really fun small park. Granted, when I was there, the entire park was freaking dead, we were the only people there, and it just seemed like a crappy little place to go in, get the credit, and then get out. But it really feels like Fun Spot is breathing new life into this place. And I'm not just saying that because they built an amazing-looking RMC that I really want to ride. But when you look at the ride collection that this park has, it's actually pretty good for a small park like this. I mean, Screamin Swings are always a good thing. Places like this almost never have a zipline. So that's great too. And the credit they have is actually really good. And of course, the fact that they have that giant RMC may defy all logic and economics, but I REALLY hope that the park thrives with that ride. I feel kind of bad for keeping the review up since it's not the same park I visited at all. But it still looks really fun and I look foreward to coming back here next time I'm in Atlanta.

*Are there kiddy coaster restrictions? - The kiddy coaster didn't exist when I was there, but I'd be SHOCKED if there were given how popular this park is with coaster enthusiasts.
