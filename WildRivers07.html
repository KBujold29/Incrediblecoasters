After hearing that Wild Rivers was closing, I knew I had to get out here, and man, closing this place is a huge mistake!
</center>

<p>

<center>
Here is the Abyss. It is the biggest operating slide in Wild Rivers. And for some reason, it makes me think of cheese.
<center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
While It looked like it was going to be good...
<center>

<p>

<center>
When the ride starts to get good, You hit the Trim Brakes. No, I am not joking. YOU GET TRIMMED ON THIS THING SEVERAL TIMES!!!!!! WHAT THE F**K!!!! DOES GOD HATE US OR WHAT!!! Well, At least we rode it first thing in the morning instead of waiting 2 hours to find out is sucks ass. I mean it! IT WAS WORSE THAN HIGH EXTREME!!! AND THAT IS SAYING ALOT!

<center>
Hi, I'm the Liquidator. You might recognize me from Malcom in the Middle. I however won't be able to let you ride me because I'm "dangerous".
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="liquidator2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OH GOD! WHY DID YOU CURSE ME SO I CAN"T SNEAK UP THE LIQUIDATOR!!!!!!! IS THIS FOR WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT!!!!!!!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wahtubee2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
This is Wahtatubee. It is fun.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wahtubee.jpg">
</center>
<center>
It has force and is Trimless. So its automatically better than Abyss.
<center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
This is Bombay Blasters. Its the most screwed up waterslide ever.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="stands.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And it has Top Thrill Dragster Stands!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bombayblasters2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Its basically a Downward S Bend that shoots you out at the ending.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bombayblasters3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
You come flying out of there faster than a speeding bullet.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="switzerfalls.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Switzer Falls is basically a waterslide version of the slide at my old elementery school.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wildrivers.jpg">
</center>
<center>
To some, This is a Ghetto Blizzard Beach.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="chaos.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Chaos looks like its going to suck.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="chaos2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And it did. It was basically a tube version of Vortex at Raging Waters.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="elephantslide.jpg">
</center>
<center>
At Wild Rivers, Elephants crap out little kids.
<center>

<p>

Some people wish we could all travel by lazy river.

</center>
<center>
Heres the entrance to Bazooka Bowls and Patriot. Lets see how they are.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="patriot.jpg">
</center>
<center>
While Patriot was slow, it at least had enough speed unlike a ceratin slide here and another certain slide at Raging Waters.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="patriot2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
This half pipe was the only thing about this ride even worth looking at.
<center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
After going on a Fake Toilet Bowl, I was curious how a Real Toilet Bowl is.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bazookabowls.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OMFG!! THIS THING IS INSANE!!!!! IT HURTS LIKE A BITCH AND HAS AS MUCH G FORCE AS A MOTHERHUMPER!!!!! THIS SLIDE HOLDS THE TRUE HELIX OF DEATH!!!!!!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bazookabowls3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Bazooka Bowls will make a little kid constipated!!!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="congoriverrapids.jpg">
</center>
<center>
They have the old school Tube Chutes like Raging Waters used to have.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="congoriverrapids3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
RAGING WATERS SUCKS!!!!!!!!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="congoriverrapids4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
These things are purposely awsome! Its like its purposely rough in a good way.
<center>

<p>
<center>

Wipeout reminds me of a snake.
<center>

<center>


<p>
<center>
<img src="bombayblasters5.jpg">

<center>


<p>

<center>
Heres the type of splash you make on Bombay Blasters.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="congoriverrapids2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
These slides are simple, but tons of fun. Just don't scratch your back.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="congoriverrapids5.jpg">
</center>
Here you can see Congo River Rapids own fake helix of death.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bazookabowls4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
You come flying around this bowl at amazing speeds with a painful thump! I will NEVER call Venom Drop a backscratcher ever again after riding this!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bazookabowls2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Another poor unfortunate soul gets flushed out of Bazooka Bowls!
<center>
