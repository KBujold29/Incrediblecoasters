All right. We have returned once again to Sea World San Diego. I know I used to rarely go to the park, but recently, this park has been adding new additions every year. And when you throw in the fact that I have a Sea World pass this year (need it to get to a certain Busch Gardens park this summer), why not take advantage of it with multiple Sea World visits. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign736.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Visit #1. Hmm. I wonder what the purpose of today's visit is. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign737.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We're here today for the Seven Seas Food Festival. This is our 3rd Theme Park Food Festival. We've done <a href="KnottsBoysenberryFestival19.html">Knotts Boysenberry Festival</a> every year and we did the <a href="MiniMidwest18CedarPoint.html">Brew & BBQ</a> event at Cedar Point. Now we're doing the Seven Seas Food Festival @ Sea World San Diego. So....let's see what sort of tasty concoctions they have here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign738.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh! Pretzal Mac & Cheese! I love Mac and Cheese, and I love pretzals. This should be awesome! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lunch85.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunately, this was the biggest dissapointment of the food festival. The mac and cheese seemed, kind of low quality. And the pretzals seemed stale. I was not impressed. =( 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign739.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know what makes a food festival even better? Beer Sampling! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="beer14.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Coasters and Beer. These are a few of my favorite things.
</center>
<p>
<center>
Just throw in travel, cliff jumping, movies, running, and we're set. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="orcaencounter5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The food and beer is great and all, but Sea World is most well known for the animals. So...let's check that out.
</center>

Aww. Who wants a belly rub? Shamu does! Yes he does!

<p>
<center>
<img src="orcaencounter8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

The show may be over, but we'll still splash your sorry ass!

<img src="lunch86.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Chicken Tikka Masala was really good. This is something I would like to order a full plate of. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="dessert31.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey! Crepes are always really good. Can't go wrong with that.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign742.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This beer is so good it'll make you....never mind.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="flamingo3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What to do with all these flamingos. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign743.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving onto a new part of the world, we're trying Carribean cuisine now.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lunch87.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Actually nope. We're having Polynesian Cusine with Kalua Pig. It was good, but....not as good as I was hoping. I'm just not the biggest pork fan (excluding bacon).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="manta16.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!! We've gone all this time in the update without a coaster!? This is IncredibleCOASTERS! We must fix that!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="manta17.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't understimate this ride. It may be small, but it has some mean laterals. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="manta18.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So while riding Manta, we essentially broke down in the brake run between the first half and the second half. It just stopped here. So....breakdown photo! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign744.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Onto Visit #2. Looks like they're doing a music festival today. Hmm. Well, that's NOT why we're here today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tidaltwister2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. THIS is why we're here today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tidaltwister4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
GOD DAMN IT!!! IT'S CLOSED TODAY!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tidaltwister3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Unfortunately, it was closed during ALL my Sea World visits this year. And when you combine the amount of downtime this had with the amount of downtime Harly Quinn had at SFDK, things don't look so good for Skyline.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="electriceel9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, let's go over a ride that actually does work and get more rides on Electric Eel is.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="electriceel10.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I know it's just a clone, but damn it! These Premier Sky Rockets really are a ton of fun! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="electriceel11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tell me guys! Was your ride ELECTRIFYING!!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="journeytoatlantis9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey guys! Let's go ride....<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX7wtNOkuHo">Never mind.</a>
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tentacletwirl2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!! I think this may be the first time I've EVER seen that ride run!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="shipwreckcafe.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Shipwreck Cafe for lunch everyone?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lunch88.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Gotta admit. The food at the Shipwreck Cafe is pretty damn good.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign745.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly, the critics don't care. =( 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="boobybird.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Go ahead. Eat the chicken. Why should I care!? I'm a booby bird! Not a chicken!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="parkinglot8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wait! Why did we leave Sea World and what are we doing in this random parking lot!?
</center>

<img src="sandiegofair.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So, we finished Sea World early today. And we figured....Hmm. The San Diego Fair is in town today. Why don't we just head on over there for the afternoon and check that out!? So here we are!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign746.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We got our San Diego Fair tickets! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sandiegofair2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This counts as our fair visit for the year.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crazymouseSDF.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. First up, the Crazy Mouse.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crazymouseSDF2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now this is NOT just the Crazy Coaster from the L.A County Fair. This is a different model. So....I get a new credit today. Was not expecting that. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crazymouseSDF3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! BEST SPINNING MOUSE EVER!!! THIS THING SPINS LIKE CRAZY!!! The only Spinning Mouse that might possibly rival it is <a href="MidAtlantic19SFA.html">Ragin Cajun</a> @ Six Flags America.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="magnum8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn! They have Magnum here! I haven't seen that ride since going to the Ventura County Fair! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tango14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
THIS RIDE IS <a href="Top10FlatRides.html">SO GOOD!!!</a> COME ON PEOPLE!!! GET BETTER TASTE IN FLAT RIDES!!!

<p>
<center>
<img src="flipperSDF.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! A Huss Flipper! I've only seen one of these in <a href="TPRHeidePark.html">Europe</a>. These rides are fun! Happy to see one in America. Kind of regret not riding it. Oh well. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="olympicbobsled.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh! Looks like I'm gonna be getting another new credit today! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="olympicbobsled3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's a Galaxy, and....it had some decent airtime. That's the good news. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="olympicbobsled2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though what's up with the big sort of fence on the side of the car. Is that really necesarry?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="speed12.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Also continuing with the highlights of the L.A County Fair, we have Speed!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="speed13.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Happy to report that <a href="LACountyFair2018.html">last years</a> lame ride on Speed was a fluke and it's back to its crazy self.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="zipper17.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, it wouldn't be a great fair if they didn't have the Zipper.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="zipper18.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is so good *drool*.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="omg.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While ride is good, it's sadly not as crazy as it looks. Then again, I'm just spoiled by Tango, Zipper, and even Speed.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="picture194.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OMG! Those cream pies, the Reeses Pies, the Oreo Pies, the Twix Pies, etc. SO GOOD!!! DAMN IT!!! NOW I WANT ONE!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="windsurf11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Man, it's been <a href="VenturaCountyFair2009.html">FOREVER</a> since I last rode Windsurf! I feel like a teenager at the Ventura County Fair riding this thing again! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sandiegofair6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, this is my favorite fair. It's all the highlights of the L.A County Fair, with what few unique rides Ventura County Fair had thrown in as well. They did a really great job here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="megadrop27.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh. Good ol' Mega Drop. This ride has been at nearly all the fairs I've been to (well, all except for the <a href="SantaBarbaraFair10.html">Santa Barbara Fair</a>).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="megadrop28.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Can someone please order one of these the size of Lex Luthor!? Cause the agressive way this SHOVES you down combined with Lex Luthors height would be so....*drool*.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="skyrideSDF.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder what we're taking the sky ride for.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sandiegofair3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Oh god! We're going to the kids section! Please don't tell me we're doing what I think we're doing!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="littledipperSDF.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh. Credit who...wait a minute! I HAVE this credit!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="wackyworm11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. There is no credit whoring today since...I HAVE both of these credits.

</center>
<center>
The only downside of this years fair visit was that there was no deep fried food credit or wacky fair food to try. I sort of forgot until I already ate and wasn't hungry.

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign747.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. They have the doctor fish spa here. Cool, but I honestly prefered having a natural one in <a href="AztecFalls2017.html">the wild</a>.
</center>

<p>

<img src="shipwreckrapids6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You in the mood for a really good water ride? Yeah. That sounds right. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign748.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
NOT AMUSED!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="sign749.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yet, despite all of work Sea World does <a href="https://www.marinemammalcenter.org/what-we-do/rescue/our-rescue-stranding-network.html">saving animals</a>, do most animal rights groups admit that Sea World is doing a great job and teaming up with them (Aside from the one that I linked to)?
</center>
<p>
<center>
No! Most of them villify them and fight against them because they once saw a sh*tty documentary! *facepalm*
</center>
<p>
<center>
Ugh. This is why I roll my eyes at animal rights activists (At least the loud online ones. The few I've met in real life aren't like this).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="picture196.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Shh. Be quiet. You wanna be like a flamingo on the wall.

Hey look! Journey to Atlantis is back open from its big rehab!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="journeytoatlantis11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunately, the rehab for Journey to Atlantis was very dissapointing.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="journeytoatlantis12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sure, it was a little better than when I rode it <a href="SeaWorldSanDiego18.html">last year</a>, but still didn't have as many effects as when I <a href="SanDiego2007.html">first rode it</a>.

So 2019 is the last year for Wild Arctic. I never really cared much about the simulator, but....still better get a final ride in.

If you're gonna put kids songs in the Billboard Top 100, pick one that isn't ear-bleedingly bad and obnoxious as f*ck. Just saying. Signed, the Beluga Whale. ;)

Even that is outside your rent budget when shopping in California.

Hey? Are you sad because you're an unlikable asshole? I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you. You should cheer yourself up by giving this porcupine a hug.

Now I'm not a big cotton candy fan. Out of all the unhealthy terrible for your body delicous carnival foods, cotton candy is towards the bottom. But some of these flavors are...WTF!? Kind of want to try some of these now.

"YOU SPENT HOW MUCH AT SEA WORLD!!?"

Though seriously, this was a super fun year at Sea World. I had a ton of fun at the park at the park, rode some great rides, saw some cool animals, and even had a great fair visit as well. Yeah, it's a bummer that I didn't get on Tidal Twister this year, but...oh well. I haven't heard good things about that ride anyway. I'll get on it next year (very soon), and I know there's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPxJoivtHaM">many things</a> to look foreward to at Sea World next year. =)
