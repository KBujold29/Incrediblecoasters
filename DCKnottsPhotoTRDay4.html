Today we went up to the Arlington cemetary. It was pretty big! There were seriously acres of 
Tombstones. The ceremony they did there was weird! It was just weird. We then went on to see the
Capital Building. It was nice, but part was under construction. In DC, most of the sites are 
closed for remodeling or something! It also seems alot like Europe, with museums, big crowded sites 
and lots of tourists with lots of hidden parts. The only real differences are that there are less people and I got a French powered coaster credit! It may have been a powered coaster, but 
it beat the crap out of the powered coaster Andrew and I rode at the <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/dragonwagon.jpg">Ventura County Fair!</a>
(No Andrew, the one in Paris isn't a credit eithter.) Anyways, back to DC. We then went to the 
Air & Space and Natural History museams. Meh, they were ok. Oh yes, we left our mark in DC by 
wrapping Isaacs slinkey around a tree! While driving to Williamsberg, we Paramounts Kings Domain 
*sniff* Thats alot of credits gone, onto todays photos.
