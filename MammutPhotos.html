We're here at Gardaland. Today's ride we'll be reviewing for you is Mammut. The park's Vekoma Mine Train. At first, it looks like the typical 2 lift hill model. But apparently, this is a custom model. But whatever. It's a fun ride and it has some really good theming. Let's move on. We get in the trains, pull down the lap bars, and we're off. We roll around a turn and into lifthill #1. And this lifthill is inside that icy mountain that is considered theming. It may look great on the outside and for offride shots. Actually inside the mountain however, not so much. But whatever. It's still really good. We reach the top, head around a banked turn which sort of turns into this downward helix. Hey, it works and we're having fun. And it looks cool thanks to the mountain theming. We rise up a small hill, go around a banked helix turn and snake around the mountain. Hey, this is a really good mine train. I'm totally enjoying this. We head around another banked turn in a tunnel, head down a small drop, and we've got ourselves a little speed. We rip around a banked turn, then dip back down into the mountain. It's fun, we come out the other side and into a brake run. Yay. That was fun. Ready for part 2? We roll around a turn and climb the 2nd lift hill. Again, it's inside the mountain and we get a nice view of Gardaland as we pop out and go down the pre-dip. We then head down this double helix, and it gradually gives us speed. And that is always a good thing. Finally, we dip back down to the fake snow on the fake mountain and we get some good laterals as we flow through a couple low to the ground turns in the mountainside. Man, this ride has good theming. It really does. We head into a helix to the ground and then go through a sharp turn. We see a flash. An onride photo has been taken and we roll into the brake run. I know that there's several mine trains out there similar to this, but this is easily one of the better mine trains out there. It has really good theming and actually has a good pace with some speed and a couple laterals. I really enjoyed it and I'm sure you will too. Definetly check it out and give it a ride.
