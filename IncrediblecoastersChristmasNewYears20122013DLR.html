Well with some convincing, I managed to convince Jen on Splash Mtn. And she liked it. Which I was impressed with since she was concerned about drops on Pirates of the Carribean earlier this morning. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwxnWi3mn6o">Does Jen still have a long ways to go before getting over her fears?</a> I mean, its not X2, but at least its SOMETHING in the right direction, which is better than nothing.

<p>
<center>
