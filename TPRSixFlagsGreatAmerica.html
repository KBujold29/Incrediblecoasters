During our drive, our awesome bus driver Bryan pointed out this gorge. He told us what this gorge is called. But I forgot and can't figure out it's name. If you know what this gorge is called, please email me and tell me.
</center>

  <img src="icebat.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Shockingly enough, there was NO Chicago Traffic at all. Which got us to the hotel where I had my photo taken with Ice Bat.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
While everyone else decided to go out to eat and drink, I took a look at my SFMM season pass and saw how close we were to SFGAm, and decided to get a little bit of bonus time at Six Flags Great America.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Somehow, I feel like I've already gotten this credit. (Oh yeah, I already have.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sixflagsgreatamerica4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello Six Flags Great America. You certainly don't look any different from how you did in my <a href="ThrillCoastersSFGAm.html">last visit.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="whizzer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First things first. I finally get to get my Whizzer credit that I couldn't get last time due to a damn break down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="whizzer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it was fun and all, I prefer the Tig'rr Coaster @ Indiana Beach that I rode just this morning.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantdrop3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Giant Drop at night.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To end my bonus night at SFGAm, I took a couple night rides on Viper. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fast foreword to the next day, we got the special privelage of being the first riders on Superman Ultimate Flight.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Kevin!! I saved you a seat!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Syke!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I miss Tatsu already.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, at least I didn't 2 hours for this like I did two years ago.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragincajin2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, Ragin Cajun, the park's spinning mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragincajin3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only is this ride not on the Qbot, but I also don't have the credit. Good thing we're riding now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragincajin4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good news. THIS RIDE KICKED ASS AND SPUN THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF US!!!!!! MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN PRIMEVAL WHIRL!!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littledipper.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Continuing on the path of getting the credits I don't have here, we rode the Little Dipper next.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littledipper2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While my morning ride on it was fun, I'm really looking foreword to our ERT on this tonight that will not and I mean not under any circumstance be cancelled for any reason whatsoever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2SFGAm7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may already have this credit, but V2 kicks ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2SFGAm8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!!! California V2 may have an inline twist, but I go faster!!! So take that Discovory Kingdom!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2SFGAm9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Twisty goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacelyssprocketrockets.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, back to getting new credits that I don't have.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacelyssprocketrockets2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Cody. I finally rode my 2nd Vekoma Roller Skater. Happy?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ironwolf4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup, next up was Iron Wolf.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ironwolf5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now I know how a lot of people hate Iron Wolf because of how unbearably rough it is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ironwolf6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And they're right. It beats the crap out of you. But for some reason, I still like it. It's sort of rough, but in a funny weird hypnotic way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign150.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thank you stupid SFOG kid. Thanks to you and your idiotic brain, these signs exist.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americaneagle6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bad news for American Eagle. It really declined in quality over the past 2 years.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americaneagle7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not necesarrily a bad woodie, but it's not nearly as cool anymore. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantdrop4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well at least Giant Drop hasn't declined in quality and still offers a giant drop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh, Raging Bull is still fun, but I just see so much wasted potential in this ride thanks to those trims.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign151.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And with that said, it's time for lunch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lunch was quite entertaining as was the Q&A with it. We even got to see Dan's weiner.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After lunch, we began our giant backstage tour with a look at Superman Ultimate Flight.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!!! Tatsu may have forces, fun, a great view, and speed. But you can't get this shot on Tatsu!! So keep that in mind next time you judge me Kevin!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermanultimateflight13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I'm still the inferior flying coaster. Arn't I."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving on with our backstage tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign152.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Yes it's true. I do in fact 69 on a daily basis and I'm damn proud of it."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yosemitiesam.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Yarr!! Who dares blow my head off!!! They don't know that they just messed with Yosemitie Sam!! They'll be sorry they ever decapitated me once I get through to them!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheelSFGAm.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is this the park's new 2011 attraction?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign153.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bullsh*t!! The sky is blue!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetrain.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Backstage tours are awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ironwolf7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Because you can get great rare shots like this one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ironwolf8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If there was only a train in this photo.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bucaneerbattle.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One Splash Battle ride is enough for this trip, thank you very much though.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Boo for Random Hair Gel Ads.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="demonSFGAm4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I didn't ride Demon this year. But I'm sure that it hasn't changed since 2008.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, lots and lots of Raging Bull Backstage Photos.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign154.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You read the sign. Everyone slow down and form a single file line please!
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Umm, a little privacy please?"
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Thanks. That's much better."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I should warn you all, this ride has very nasty trims.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thanks for the warning strange man with the camera.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Rare angle of Raging Bull.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Where'd all the speed go?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Backstage Viper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Double Dip Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="street4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, I had to go to a bank to get money, which was frustrating and difficult to find since I got lost. (I hate it when a street has 2 different names. It makes things such a pain in the ass.) Unfortunetly, I couldn't get the money til tomorrow, which made the whole thing pointless.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantherideSFGAm4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. Time for another Batman the ride Clone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantherideSFGAm5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey, you know that the blue color scheme is currently in."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantherideSFGAm6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"So, I'm still the original and best Batman the ride."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantherideSFGAm7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, it's still an awesome ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="darkknight.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of Batman, I still have to get my Dark Knight credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="darkknight2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Who's the freak with the mask?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="darkknight3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not a bad ride. It's just not nearly as good as the park makes it out to be and doesn't match the theming. It's basically the Dr. Von Dark of coasters. (Or rather, Dr. Von Dark is the Dark Knight of water slides.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh oh. Those clouds don't look good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign155.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on. You're going to close the coasters just because of a little rain?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, now it's time to play the "Find an open ride game."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fiddlersfling.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We found a winner!! Fiddler's Fling was still open!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fiddlersfling2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, that's not a blurry photo. The ride actually spins that fast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Please don't tell me that this is the end of our Little Dipper ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to the TPR Bridge Party. Where all hopes and dreams of Little Dipper ERT come to die.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy crap. The rain really got a lot harder.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No!! I must flee the TPR Bridge Party before all my hopes and dreams of Little Dipper ERT die!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I'm making a rain angel. And I shall call him Mr. Angel."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap. We've got thunder and lightning here too. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, lightning is a bitch to photograph, so that's why I have this video camera still of the lightning. (I was lucky to get that earlier still at all.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When did it become daytime? Oh, it's just the lightning.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, that rain is coming down pretty hard.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"A little help over here. I'm kind of stuck."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure how it happened, but Dan actually got wet!!! =o
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderstorm12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. The storms dead now. Time for Viper ERT!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
YAY!!!!! VIPER ERT!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
EXCITEMENT EVERYONE!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While last nights rides were fun, they had nothing on this ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="viperSFGAm9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
To make things better, the ride ran much better thanks to the rain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We also had ERT on Raging Bull.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, this kicked some serious ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingbull15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think the rain helped Raging Bull as well since those were the best Raging Bull rides I ever had.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign156.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Somehow, I wouldn't be suprised if this weather report was actually accurate.
