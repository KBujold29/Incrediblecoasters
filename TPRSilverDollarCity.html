</center>
<center>
Ok. That's really depressing. We need something to cheer us up.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverdollarcity.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That'll do the trick.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Today was an awesome day at Silver Dollar City.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign136.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't believe me, just look at our schedule for today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverdollarcity3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is stunningly beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gunshop.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They really nailed the 1800s town look down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverdollarcity4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just to let you know where we are.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tiktok2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yikes. Look at all that funky jerky they have. I should've tried the Kangaroo Jerky.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh well. Enough of that. We have rollercoasters to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride was awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakery.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Another thing that people rave about here is their Cinnamon Bread.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign137.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Surely, it's just bread. It can't be THAT good?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cinnamonbread.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Holy Sh*t!!! This stuff is amazing!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireinthehole.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, Fire in the Hole.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireinthehole2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not count as a credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireinthehole3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But that doesn't mean this wasn't a kickass dark ride. "FIRE IN THE HOLE!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign138.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Where can I find this attraction? I can't find it on the park map.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay! Now it's time for us to ride Wildfire!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Heading straight up the lifthill.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's no Kumba, but Wildfire is still one kickass B&M. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey! I didn't think this ride had arm banging!!! Wait, how is this even possible?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beesting.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No wait, that was just a bee stinging me in the arm on the ride. And the bee was still attached to the stinger. So that made for a very interesting meet and greet.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
  <p>Hey, at least it wasn't a goose that attacked me. </p>

</center>
<center>
  <p>I may have been stung, but I lived to tell the tale. Incrediblecoasters 1. Bee 0. </p>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="barnswing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Next up, Giant Barn Swing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderation.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. This just looks like an ordinary mine train.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderation2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only is this mine train more insane than any other mine train, but you can also ride it backwards!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riverblast.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. River Blast broke down on us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandexpositioncoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In that case, time to get the final credit here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandexpositioncoaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cha Ching.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="electrospin.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Disk-O here is actually a pretty insane one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="royalteaparty.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Teacups anyone?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icee2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Nothing refreshes you like a nice Cherry Coke Icee. (Yes, you can make that thanks to the beauty of the self mixing Icee Machine.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riverblast2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet!! River Blast opened back up for us!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riverblast3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, considering that this is a Splash Battle, this is an acceptable amount of wetness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lostriver.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think I've got wet enough today, thank you very much.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="barnswing2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Back to the giant barn swing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="barnswing3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These things are awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign139.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This park's sense of humor is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cow.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You two keep milking that cow, I'll go get the Cocoa Puffs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="floodedmine.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet. Time for the park's shooting dark ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="floodedmine2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Can I take these guns back home to Australia?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantskillet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh my god. The food here is phenomonal. Everything in that skillet is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dippindots.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This park may have drained all the money left in my wallet after buying my new camera, but dammit! It was worth it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandfathersmansion.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Grandpa. We just popped back in Ventura to give you a quick visit."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandfathersmansion2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Something about this isn't right.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandfathersmansion3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey Grandpa. If this is what you did to the inside of your house, then I'm really looking foreword to seeing what you did to that farm in the backyard."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coke3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Like I said before, this place is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign140.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If I could, I would.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dinner was awesome. This time during trivia, I won a book. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!! Back to Powder Keg.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If someone said "I want to go on something more thrilling than California Screamin, but not nearly as insane as Maverick", you'd pretty much get Powder Keg right there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Powder Keg Twistiness,
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="powderkeg6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"EXCITEMENT!!!! 3 2 1!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americanplunge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. What's American Plunge?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americanplunge2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think I'll pass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'll just stick to Wildfire, thank you very much.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may not be as crazily forceful as Kumba, but hey. Kumba doesn't have ejector air on the first drop. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Look out for those bees. They're gonna get you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildfire8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wildfire is one kickass B&M that will be here to stay for a very long time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shirt3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All those excuses are lame. Get your ass on Wildfire.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterfall4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did I mention that Silver Dollar City is beautiful?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderation3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey SFMM, why not give Goldrusher a little special Thunderation treatment. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What exactly is the Marvel Cave you ask?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Marvel Cave is an actual cave that Silver Dollar City owns and gives tours to. And it's not an upcharge. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to hell. (Seriously, the local indians originally thought that this was the entrance to hell.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Silver Dollar City is amazing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, I now know that this is not hell. (If it was, I would be forced to ride Dragon repeatedly while being forced to sit next to Satan herself.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We at Incrediblecoasters would not recommend the Cave Tour to anyone with Claustrophobia.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Even an object the size of an atom?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ha Ha!!! I fooled you all!!! This really is hell. The three stooges lead by the devil herself will soon escort you all to Dragon where you will ride it till your skull is crushed into a million peices.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Am I really at an amusement park?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, my tour was the last tour to ever feature the bats. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="marvelcave11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Then when it's all over, the whole tour is crammed into this tiny little tram and you get dragged back up to civilization.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="melloyello.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And finally, I've noticed that Mello Yello actually exists here in the Midwest. They even had it at the McDonalds in Wisconson. Please come to CA Mello Yello. I miss you.
