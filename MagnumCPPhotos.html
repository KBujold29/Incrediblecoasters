Today at Incrediblecoasters, we're going to be reviewing Magnum XL 200 at Cedar Point. After getting in the cars and pulling down the lap bar, you go out of the station. First, you just go through some straight track. But then you eventually head to the lifthill, you say to yourself, "You call this big? Millenium Force is MUCH bigger than this ride." Then about 20 seconds later, you realize that you are still climbing the lifthill. You then think about how much bigger Millenium Force is than Magnum XL 200, and yet, you'd be past the first drop already if you were riding Millenium Force. But then we remember that Magnum XL 200 has MUCH better airtime. So that takes our minds off this. We eventually reach the top. We then drop. Speed comes rushing down on us as we reach the bottom of the first drop.  We then rise high up into the sky for the second hill. From the top, you get a nice view of Lake Erie. Then we then slightly twist down as we plummet down straight for the first tunnel. We blast right through it. And before we know it, we're roaring straight into hill #3. But at the top of the third hill, we are greeted with a nasty little trim brake. We then wonder were all the airtime this ride was supposed to have.  We then roar straight into the Pretzal Turnaround. We rise up and helix up to the left. As we go through the pretzal turn, we then realize why that trim brake was added to the third hill. We get a nice view of Lake Erie before helixing back down to the left. We then rise up where we see Tunnel #2. Then while in the tunnel, we notice that our thighs have smashed something. Ladies and Gentlemen, the airtime has begun. We then fly out of the tunnel and into the next airtime hill. It may smash our thighs, but it's so worth it for the amazing airtime the ride produces.  We then rise into a curved sort of hill. Unfortunetly, there's no airtime there. But looky here. A whole series of bunny hops to the brake run. Airtime galore. The first three bunny hops are all outdoors, but then we head into the 3rd tunnel where our thighs get one final smack of airtime before heading into the brake run. Not only does the ride have amazing airtime, but it was the world's first hyper coaster. Plus it usually doesn't have a very long line. I would totally recommend riding Magnum XL 200 if you're at Cedar Point. Don't listen to anything your thighs may try to tell you. It's all worth it.
