We're here at Knotts Berry Farm. We wanted to see some construction on Pony Express. And since last time we went to Knotts, there was a <a href="Fall2007PhotosKBF.html">wildfire nearby,</a> we decided to go today. And here is a view of Knotts from the Radisson Hotel.

Ok, by now, you've porbably heard of all the Gum stuff. Like <a href="SixFlagsMagicMtnSummer2005.html">Revolution's Gum Seat,</a> <a href="SixFlagsMagicMtnSpring2006.html">Superman's Gum Sign,</a> <a href="14thBirthdayParty.html">Goldrusher's Gum Lifthill,</a> <a href="KnottsSummer2007.html">Montezooma's Gum Rails,</a> and Jet Stream's Gum Tunnel. But now ladies and gentelmen, brace yourself for Supreme Scream's SPIT SIGN!!! (YES! THAT IS DRIED SPIT ON THE SIGN!!!!)

Meh, It's not like there's a brain to freeze anyway.

</center>
<center>
All right!! Time for a crazy water ride that I haven't ridden in a while!!!
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Ok. For those who don't know, Originally, Perilous Plunge opened with lap bar restraints. But then, some fat lady fell out and then they had to use f**king four point restraints. But that didn't work since 95% of the people were either too fat or too skinny. So then, they got these new boats. But these have been criticized for having OTSRs and reducing the splash. But on Perilous Plunge, it's not about the splash, it's about the EJECTOR AIR!!!!!!!

<center>
Oh yeah, there's no water on Riptide anymore. Meh, It's not like I ride Riptide anyway.

Oh look!! What's that?
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Why it's Knotts new coaster Pony Express. It looks better than I thought it would.
</center>

<p>

<center>

</center>
<center>
From here, you can see the size of Pony Express.

<center>
Now it's time for the B&M of the day. Good ole Silver Bullet.
</center>

<p>

<center>
 WORST HEARTLINE SPIN EVER!!!
</center>

<p>

<center>
<img src="silverbullet27.jpg">
</center>
<center>
The corkscrews are decent though.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder10.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And all though you can't tell in this picture, Sierra Sidewinder is indeed stuck on the lifthill.
</center>

<p>
<center>

<img src="peanutsplayhouse11.jpg">
</center>
<center>
While we waited for Sierra Sidewinder to open, we went into the Peanuts Playhouse for Celeste. 
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Celeste fits in here so well. (Part of me is being sarcastic and part of me is serious when I say this!)

<center>

Celebreties are the only exeption.

</center>
<center>
I am so upset about not being able to ride the Snoopy Bounce that I'm want to throw my wig off and have a random meltdown about how I can't see my kids and how I can't jump in the Snoopy Bounce.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevenge14.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Time for a good old classic Shuttle Loop.

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevenge15.jpg">

<center>
This ride is still fun despite being os old.

Hi. I'm Britney Spears II. I have completely lost my mind and now I think I'm a peach flavored butterfly. To see my adventures as a Peach Flavored Butterfly, click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky4kZYnvmeg">here.</a>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
 Time for the real forceless atracction of the park!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguar11.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Why did I even ride this?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dragonswing2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hi Andrew! We rode the Pirate Ship! HA HA!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dragonswing3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Read the caption above.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder11.jpg">
</center>
<center>
By this time, Sierra Sidewinder had reopened. So we went and rode it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder12.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Apperently Peach Flavored Butterflys jinx spinning coasters as we rode in every single car, and every singe time, our car barely spun at all!!! (We even apoligized to the people behind us for ruining their ride at one point!)
</center>

<p>

<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder13.jpg">
</center>
<center>
But even a jinxed Sierra Sidewinder is better than that Peice of S**t Pole Position.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider14.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And now, the only coaster left to ride was Ghostrider. 
</center>

<p>
<center>

<img src="ghostrider15.jpg">
</center>
<center>
If you remember from last time, you heard about Ghostrider was ridicously rough and I was hoping that wouldn't be the case today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider16.jpg">
</center>
<center>
While there was plenty of jackhammering on the ride, it was more of a happy "This is a woodie. Enjoy it!" roughness instead of a "DIE YOU STUPID BITCH!" roughness. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider17.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Yummy Ghostrider Goodness! 
</center>

<center>
Here's a look at Ghostrider's helix of fake death.

<center>
Overall, this was a great trip. Peroulis Plunge, Pony Express Construction, and Peach Flavored Butterflys really made this a truely great update and it totally brightened up my aside from this day, crappy spring break.
