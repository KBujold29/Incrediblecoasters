OMG!!! I know I've been in Japan for over 2 weeks now! I've seen a ton of cool stuff, visited a lot of parks and ridden many coasters I've been wanting to ride for years. I've seen the heart of Tokyo and seen so much in a country that I just absolutely love. But now, its time to go somewhere that may possibly be the place in Japan I've been wanting to go to the most. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="trainstation3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is so cool that it has its very own train station. And yeah. This place needs it. =)
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ambassadorhotel.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Walking by the Ambassador Hotel.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ambassadorhotel2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I don't have the money for all this, as this trip is on the cheap side. But this does look like a really nice hotel.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds88.png" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I may have gotten here early, but yeah. This is Tokyo Disney. So yeah. It's gonna be crowded today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds89.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. This place is crowded, but honestly, the crowds here aren't as bad as the ones at Universal Studios Japan.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign689.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is only 35 years old!? How did people cope without Tokyo Disney Sea 36 years ago!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No. I'm not in some random village. I'm at Tokyo Disney Sea.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds90.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OH MY GOD!!! I'M HERE!!! I'M HERE!!! I'M HERE!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello Tower of Terror. I'll be riding you later on tonight. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We have to start with what may be the most anticipated ride of the trip.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture165.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* You mean there's more than just liquid rock in the middle of the Earth!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearthline.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Almost there!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fastpass8.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Damn it! Journey broke down on us! Lame! =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Tokyo Disney just decided, "Hey. You know what our park needs? A giant volcano in the middle!". The theming here is just....DAMN!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain42.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Love the sea serpent fountain they have here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="electricrailway.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh how quaint. They have an Electric Railway here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds91.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place may look horrendously mobbed, but as long as you're smart, you can navigate these crowds just fine.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tower of Terror amongst all the Christmas decorations.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'll give my thoughts on the actual ride later on, but I'll just admit up front. Tokyo Tower has my favorite exterior. Seriously, this thing looks amazing.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sscolumbia.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did they just buy a ship and just stick it here for theming!? Cause damn! I love that attention to detail!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Really hope that volcano is dormant and doesn't go off anytime soon. =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign703.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, Duffy is extremely popular here too, 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the park is right on the ocean, this is just a lake in the middle of the park solely for theming. Seriously, I do NOT feel like I'm in Japan right now.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="aquatopia3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love exploring and all, but we have to go on a ride! So hey. Aquatopia.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="aquatopia.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aquatopia is a very....intersting ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="aquatopia2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride doesn't really do all that much. It just goes around the water and spins in circles. But for some reason, it's just a ton of fun.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="aquatopia4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I have no idea why this is so fun, but I just really like this.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds92.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place has a river of people flowing through it, but all I can think about is how much I love this place and how it kicks ass! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="parade6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello random tuba player.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What's up with all the fireworks over here!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn it! I missed one of the shows they had! Oh well. There's so much more to check out over here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="clarice.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! It's that female chipmunk. I think her name was Clarice. Apparently she was literally only in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_Fl-jV6VAk">one Chip'N'Dale cartoon!</a> But despite so little screen time, she still appears at Tokyo Disneysea. Is that specific cartoon really popular in Japan or do they just allow all Disney characters into the parade?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! Journey to the Center of the Earth opened back up.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Journey to the Center of the Earth is a ride that uses the same technology as Test Track and Radiator Springs Racers. Except the theming and the theme of this ride is so much better that the ride is just....DAMN!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry Test Track. I love you and all, but....JOURNEY IS THE <a href="Top10DarkRides.html">BEST DARK RIDE EVER</a>!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How many of you see the entrance to Vulcania? =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="volcania.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of which, that's where we're having lunch today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="volcania2.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
So Vulcania is a Chinese Resteraunt right in the middle of Mysterious Island. The setting alone makes this one of the best resteraunts in any park.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="volcania3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But on top of that, you have to eat here if you like Chinese Food. The dumplings are some of the best!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds93.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Excuse me, but is this place crowded today?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't be fooled. This place may have a globe right at the front of the park, but this is NOT a Universal park. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign690.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Tokyo Disney! It's Nove...*drool*!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture166.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know Disney always goes above and beyond with their Christmas decorations, but DAMN!!! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture167.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey fellas! I gotta question! How come I, as a doggo, can talk, but the doggo next to me can't!?"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I just can't get over the theming here! I want that to be my normal view so badly!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="nemofriendssearider.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's check out one of the newest rides they have here. Nemo and Friends Searider.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="nemofriendssearider3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good to see that this ride takes advantage of all the characters from Finding Dory.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="nemofriendssearider2.png" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So it's basically a simulator, similar to Star Tours. Only with the story of the Finding Nemo Submarines at Disneyland. Definetly my favorite of the Finding Nemo rides.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign691.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Feeling homesick? No worries, just head on over to the Mexico section and suddenly, I feel like I'm back home! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="indianajonesTDS2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! Here's the only other Indiana Jones in a Disney park. So now I've got both.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="indianajonesTDS5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Spoiler alert. I love Indiana Jones back home at Disneyland. And I also love it here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="indianajonesTDS6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So instead of being the Temple of Doom and looking into the Eyes of Mara, this one is the temple of the Crystal Skull (No, it has nothing to do with crappy Indiana Jones 4. This came out 8 years before that).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="indianajonesTDS7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One element found on Japanese Indiana Jones is the Fireball Ring, where a ring of fire is shot at the car. I really like that.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="indianajonesTDS8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"F*ck this! I'm moving to Japan! No snakes over there!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign694.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of course, having a Single Riders Line will save your ass here. Those things are freaking awesome.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue66.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you're too into cartoons and can't enjoy Indiana Jones, well, they've got Explorer Mickey Mouse for you.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just a quick reminder. We are IncredibleCOASTERS. So yeah. Time to ride a roller coaster.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign692.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Apparently, having a loop on their roller coaster is a big deal. Psst, hey locals, there are other coasters with inversions here in Tokyo. =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits3.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
While this may look like a Crappy Pinfari Looper, it's actually a fun ride,
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. It may look like a Pinfari from afar, but look closer, and this ride is WAY more stable than a Pinfari Looper that looks like it belongs at a carnival.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, being a Disney coaster with a loop, this ride scares a lot of people.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sure, it's no California Screamin or Rock'N'Rollercoaster, but Raging Spirits is still a fun ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wheel5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello traditional water wheel.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We've been to America, Myserious Island, and Mexico. Where else can we go? Oh, I know! The Arabian Coast! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="caravancarousel.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure why this carousel works so much, but this just looks so cool.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain43.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
With how hot it gets in the Middle East, you better cherish that water.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to check out one of the surprisingly best dark rides out there, Sinbad's Storybook Voyage.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
EVERYONE RESTRAIN THE BIRD!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage3.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And again, Sinbad broke down. LAME!!! =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I did not expect to like the Arabian Coast as much as I did. Seriously, this land is awesome. Part of it really makes me want to visit the Middle East, but yeah. That's being ruined by a toxic combination of our horrendous foreign policy and fundamentalist Islam.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So if you've read ANY Tokyo Disney Photo TRs (or just read about the park from anywhere), then you'll know that Tokyo Disney LOVES popcorn, and in particular, has all sorts of weird popcorn flavors that seem to be exclusive to the park. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For instance, our first popcorn flavor of the trip is Curry Popcorn.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn4.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Now this may sound really weird, and gross. But Curry Popcorn is REALLY good. It has a little bit of a curry kick to it, but it's not overwhelming. It tastes like it was seasoned with a sort of curry powder, where it's good, and has a flavorful kick, but won't overwhelm you if you don't like spicy foods. HIGHLY recommended.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="panchito.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Continuing with the theme of "Japan has all sorts of characters no one else cares about", you can meet Panchito in the Lost River Delta (Mexico) port of entry.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="panchito2.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I've always been saying that the Three Caballeros (particuarly Jose & Panchito) are underrated. So of course, I had to stop and snap a crappy selfie with Panchito.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Why are we heading back to the Arabian Coast so soon?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I keep forgetting that I'm in Japan while over here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign704.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can I buy my own Abu in there?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain44.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Jasmine with her own fountain.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="jasminesflyingcarpets.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wait. Jasmine's Flying Carpets? Shouldn't it be Aladdin's Flying Carpets?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue67.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh Raja. Stop worrying. The fact that the golden tiger next to you has demon eyes is nothing to worry about.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh right! Sinbad's Storybook Voyage opened back up and now it's time to ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Sinbad is a ride that is sort of like It's a Small World. Only MUCH better!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bon Voyage Sinbad!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So the story is that Sinbad and his pet tiger, Chandu (who is AWESOME!!!) are off on a journey to get goods for his local village, and they come across some friendly characters on the way.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Meow! No asshole! That's my treasure! It's mine! Meow! I'm Chandu!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That giant may look like a threat, but no worries. He just wants to play music with you.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

You see all the animatronics on this ride? There are TONS of them on this ride. And not only that, but they are very fluid, move a lot, and....it's just really impressive to see all the attention to detail Disney put on this ride!

This theming is here for a limited time only! Come one, come all, come see this amazing theming before it's gone and turns back into a parking lot!

<center>
So that Electric Railway is not only really good theming that enhances the atmosphere of the park. But it also works as a railway. I love that.

Sitting on that boat, relaxing while sailing around the lagoon in Tokyo Disney Sea. Sounds like a good evening to me.

Time for Popcorn Flavor #2. We're now eating Black Pepper Popcorn.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn6.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Black Pepper popcorn is another flavor where it sounds kind of strange. But it's really good. It's basically fresh popcorn, but with a lot of black pepper. Not too much where it ruins it, but enought to give it a nice kick.

Sunset falls upon Tokyo Disneysea. And more fun is to be had at night!

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder what I'm doing waiting out here by the main lagoon?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're watcing Japanese Fantasmic tonight.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. I don't wanna go into Mickey's imagination. I wanna stay at Tokyo Disneysea!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey! I really liked Fantasmic at Disneyland. So it's gonna be good to see how it is in Tokyo.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
This one is a little different as it uses the World of Color technology.

Mickey sending out the S.O.S Flares. His imagination is getting out of control!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. One thing that is still a bummer is that there aren't as many villians in this one. Why is it only Florida that gets all the villians?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But even so, Fantasmic is still a fantastic show that I highly recommend.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fantasmicTDS9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Don't you dare think of hurting Tokyo Disneysea Malificent! F*ck putting Aurora to sleep! That's your real crime!

I know there are tons of photos of the lava monster out there. But yeah. Holy Sh*t! This is one of the most impressive anamatronics from Disney! WE NEED MORE LAVA MONSTER!!!

  <img src="dinner34.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So I went down to grab dinner, consisting of a Gyoza Dog (Yum) and I tried the Hot Wine (Damn you Logan! You lied to me and said it was amazing! It's good, but not any better than other wine! Damn you!) and I bumped into Brandon, Logan's friend from Tokyo. We ate dinner, chatted, and just had a really good meal.

<center>
Fun fact, the S.S. Columbia was inspired by the Queen Mary in Long Beach, which I do get to see a lot. But this is much better since it's in Tokyo Disneysea.

Popcorn Flavor #3. We decided to take a break from savory popcorn flavors and go for something more sweet. In this case, Strawberry.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn8.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
This is sweet. Very sweet. Almost like a candy. I can easily some people being put off by it. But I have a big sweet tooth and this one was REALLY good for me.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture168.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

It's technically not, but you do such a good job making it seem like Christmas that I'm just gonna pretend that it is. =)

<center>
All right. Time to check out another port. This one is Mermaid Lagoon.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue68.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lose the fake antlers King Triton. I know you're just trying to get into the Christmas Spirit, but Dolphins > Reindeer.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tritonskingdom.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I gotta hand it to you King Triton. Your port-of-entry is really awesome.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue69.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How can Mickey survive down here to conduct the band? Bah! Who cares! Just enjoy it under the sea!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mermaidlagoon4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. You know all those Best Kids Area awards that the Golden Ticket Awards does? They don't give it to Mermaid Lagoon. So f*ck them!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="jumpingjellyfishTDS.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look. They also have Jumping Jellyfish here. But it's much better here, as....it makes a lot more sense in the Little Mermaid area. Not to mention, having it indoors and themed to being underwater. It really helps with theming.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="icecreamstand.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Sorry folks. The Ice Cream stand is closed for the night.

<p>
<center>
  <img src="floundersflyingfish.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So that's why I'm down here. I'm here to do more credit whoring.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="floundersflyingfish2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But this isn't any ordinary coaster. First off, it's a Togo Rollerskater. But more importantly, I hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgnKrGK1_A4">600</a> on Flounder's Flying Fish!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="floundersflyingfish3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I don't care that it wound up being the kiddy coaster! Having a milestone at Tokyo Disneysea is F*CKING AWESOME!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And after waiting all day, the time has finally come. Our Tower of Terror fastpass is finally ready! =D
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture181.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Love the snowflakes on the ground.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Boy. I sure have upgraded my hotel. I guess I figured I shouldn't be staying in a cheapass capsule hostel while visiting the Tokyo Disney Resort.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDSline.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. All the theming is nice in here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So the Twilight Zone isn't popular in Japan (Seriously, that show is awesome. Highly recommended), so instead of doing the Twilight Zone, they have a completely custom story for Japanese Tower of Terror.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So the story of this ride is that Harrison Hightower is a wealthy asshole who inherits a mansion from his dad. Being a savy businessman, he rennovates the place and turns it into a fancy hotel. However, when he goes on a safari in Africa, he comes across an uncontacted tribe, who idolizes a god named Shikiri. Wanting it all for himself, he takes Shikiri back to his hotel in NYC. But when he gets back, Mr. Hightower dissapears and everyone assumes that Shikiri is responsible, and that the hotel is now haunted.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I have to admit. Japanese Tower has the best story of them all. Shikiri > Twilight Zone > Guardians of the Galaxy.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS12.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now for one of the few dissapointments of the trip. Japanese Tower of Terror. Storywise, it's the best. I absolutely LOVE the story they have here. But putting that aside and just focusing on the actual ride, this is the weakest Tower of Terror. I thought it was gonna be a clone of French Tower of Terror or the old California Tower. But sadly, this seemed to have less drops, and it didn't seem like the airtime was quite as strong. Still really cool as the drops are still really fun, and I LOVE Shikiri that much. I just wish it had a better drop program. =(

Well, Tokyo Disney Sea is amazing. And that's just one of the parks here! For tomorrow, we get to check out the other one!

OK. Day 2 of the Tokyo Disney Resort. And oh god. Umbrellas? Looks like the weather is not on our side today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds95.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh well. When you're at a Disney Park, half of all the rides are indoors. So rain doesn't affect your day like it does at most theme parks.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneyland.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So we were at Tokyo Disneysea yesterday. This means that today is our Tokyo Disneyland day.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds96.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How do you know that this is Tokyo Disneyland? Because like all Japanese Parks, Main Street here is covered. ;) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="castleTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I found the castle!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="castleTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Tokyo Disneyland's castle is essentially the same castle as Magic Kingdom in Florida. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fastpass9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We got our Monsters Inc. fastpass. Looking foreward to riding that later today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. We got our Monsters fastpass, but now it's time for our first ride at Tokyo Disneyland.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're riding Space Mountain now.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This Space Mountain still has the escelator. Japan is awesome. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's a classic staple. Seriously, I think Space Mountain might be the the only ride at ALL the Disney parks (Damn you Shanghai Disneyland! You ruined it from being 6/6)!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDLline.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Glad I got in line before the line really began to grow.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Screw the Milky Way Galaxy! I wanna travel to the Coca Cola Galaxy! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sad to say this, but this is the worst out of all the Space Mountains.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This Space Mountain honestly...feels like it was stuck in the 70s. I feel like Japan's Space Mountain is what California's used to be like before it got it's big makeover. But seriously, music is super important to Space Mountain.

Ooh! I wonder what is under construction right here? I know they're building a big <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ce5bjFY1Faw">Beauty and the Beast</a> ride for 2020 (Can't wait to come back and ride that). Maybe this is that. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="smallworldTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Considering how this ride gets really busy, we better get this out of the way first.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="smallworldTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, we're bothering to ride Japanese Small World.
</center>
	
<p>

Excuse me. But what time is it?

<p>
<center>
  <img src="smallworldTDL7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
One of the upsides of riding Small World in foreign countries is that you get to see how your home country is portrayed by other people.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="smallworldTDL6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />

While we can't get a fastpass for Pooh, we can at least still get a new popcorn credit. Popcorn Flavor #4. Honey.
</center>
	
<p>

"Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! I'm making some Honey Popcorn for my good pal, Pooh! Hey! No! None for you assholes! Now shoo! T.T.F.N Ta-ta for now!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn11.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So the Honey Popcorn is the flavor closest to a traditional normal flavor. It's got a nice sweet taste to it. Not quite as sweet as your standard Kettle Corn, but still has a nice taste to it. Thumbs up.

Stitch Encounter!? They stole the ride from Florida and put it here!? Really!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="stitchencounter2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. It turns out that Stitch Encounter is a show like Turtle Talk with Crush where people in the audience could talk to Stitch.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="stitchencounter3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Being here felt awkward. As....I don't speak Japanese. So if Stitch called on me, I'd probably just stare blankly and say "Kon'nichiwa. Watashinonamaeha Kevin. Uh.....Sumimasen. Gomen'nasai" (Hello. My name is Kevin. Uh.....Excuse Me. Sorry). Yeah. I'm not gonna do this again next time.

It's mostly the same standard Haunted Mansion, but there are a couple extra scenes that we don't have back home.
</center>

Big Thunder Mountain is closed? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_R2-7rPTxCg">NOOOOO!!!!!</a>
</center>
<center>
But seriously, while this is annoying and all. But at least it wasn't a surprise. I knew this would be closed since April 2018 when another friend visited Tokyo Disney and mentioned that Pooh was closed for maintanence, which made me check the website for my trip, and sure enough, Thunder Mountain was closed the entire three weeks I was visiting Japan. So I at least had ample warning about this. And hey, I'll come back and ride it next time.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign697.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, Thunder Mountain may be closed, but I believe there's another famous Disney Mountain that we can check out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="splashmtnTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. Time to check out Splash Mountain.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="splashmtnTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And with Tokyo Splash Mountain done, I've now collected ALL the Splash Mountains. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture171.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

This may possibly be the only ride that transports you to the Deep South (Hey, gonna be back there next week)

Looks like Fantasyland is popular around here. Oh wait. This is Tokyo Disneyland. It's always crowded here. =)
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="parade8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Another random parade that I missed. But hey, those happen all the time at Tokyo Disneyland.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to wait in the one long line of Tokyo Disneyland. Yep. Time to suck it up and just wait for one of the rides that I've been curious in for years. Pooh's Hunny Hunt.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So some of you who aren't familiar with Tokyo Disneyland may be wondering why I'm so excited for just a Fantasyland Dark Ride. Well, let me tell you. This is not your ordinary Fantasyland Dark Ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Rabbit likes big butts and he can not lie!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt4.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
"I say, Pooh. That is not the proper cliff jumping position."
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Pooh's Hunny Hunt is a trackless dark ride.  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So as a trackless dark ride, meaning you can just go all around the room, and since there's no track you never quite know where you're going (Fun fact. Aquatopia also uses the trackless dark ride technology).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Easily, my favorite part of Pooh's Hunny Hunt is the Tigger Room, where you go into a room, and you bounce around with tigger. And it literally feels like you're bouncing. It's just a ton of fun. And now, I have the Japanese version of "The Wonderful Thing About Tiggers" stuck in my head!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See the room with all the Heffelumps & Woozles, thanks to it being a trackless dark ride, all the cars sort of dance to the music, and interact with one another, and....I love this ride.

Popcorn Flavor #5. And this is a weird one. Soy Sauce & Butter!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn13.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!! WHO KNEW SOY SAUCE & BUTTER POPCORN WAS SO GOOD!!! I did NOT expect to like this flavor as much as I did. Had no idea what to expect, but I absolutely love this flavor. It's very salty, got a very fatty, buttery taste, not too much, but enough where you can taste all the salty fatty goodness. The brown peices are the best!!!
</center>

Hey look! My Monsters Ride 'N' Seek Fastpass is finally valid!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign699.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What!? You don't scare anymore!? I gues you just don't care anymore! ='(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="monstersrideandseek2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Monsters Ride 'N' Seek is essentially a shooting dark ride. Except you're taking your flashlights and using them to find Boo throughout the ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="monstersrideandseek3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be the best ride ever, but it still is a lot of fun, and I do wish that they had this at DCA instead of the Monsters Inc. ride they currently have.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="monstersrideandseek4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Nothing particuarly special about Japanese Pirates. It's mostly the same standard ride. Well, with one exception.

<center>
Another thing to note about Japanese Pirates. It doesn't have the lifthill like the rest of them. It just lets you off after all the cannons are fired and the pirates are in prison, and you take an escelator up to the surface, much like on Haunted Mansion. Not sure if I prefer this or having the lifthill.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn15.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
OK. This one, I wasn't crazy for. I guess there was a little bit of a smoky hint to it, but eh. Kind of underwhelming. Not bad, but....far from the best.

  <img src="mainstreetelectricalparadeTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mainstreetelectricalparadeTDL4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Hey look! There's a movie that doesn't get a lot of love (even with its recent remake).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mainstreetelectricalparadeTDL2.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />

I know I don't ride the one at Disneyland very often, but these are fun rides.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="cartoonspinTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Tokyo Disneyland is also the only other Disney park besides Disneyland to feature Cartoon Spin. Bummer as this ride is a lot of fun.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="cartoonspinTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
We need more rides based on Who Framed Roger Rabbit! Seriously, Best Disney Movie ever (No, I'm not kidding)!

<p>
<center>
  <img src="buzzlightyearTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, Buzz Lightyear has always been one of those rides I've always skipped at Disney Parks not in California, missing it in both Florida and Paris. I nearly decided to skip it here too for the sake of tradition. But it's only amusing if I skip it without thinking about it. So yeah. I'm doing Japanese Buzz Lightyear.

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

We have so much time and have pretty much done everything that....Let's check out the 2nd showing of the Light the Night Fireworks!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These fireworks are essentially standard Disney Fireworks set to Disney songs with special effects and cool illustrations on the castle.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But with that said, it's still a really cool show.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
FIRE!!!! BURN IT ALL TO THE GROUND!!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not to mention the fact that this show is also a big strobe show is really cool. Disney Rave!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lightthenight6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

<p>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="protesters.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So there were these protesters right in the Tokyo Disney Resort, right in between the two parks. I have no idea what they were protesting about since I can't understand what they're saying, I can't read their signs, and I don't know jack-sh*t about Japanese politics. But if there's any place on Earth where I want to be free from the mental hell that's politics, it's here.
</center>
	
<p>

</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="20000leaguesTDS2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Thank you Mickey and Minnie for reminding me that I'm at Tokyo Disney Sea. If not for you, I'd probably start thinking that I was on the U.S East Coast.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn16.png" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. Time for a more normal flavor. Popcorn Flavor #7. Chocolate.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn17.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
It tastes better than you think. Most people think of Chocolate Popcorn as popcorn just coated in chocolate. This is not that. I'm not sure if they dusted it in Chocolate powder or what. But it did not have the standard frosting-like coating I usually see on Chocolate-covered popcorn. And this was better.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />

Why yes. A morning ride on Tower of Terror does sound good.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS10.png" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
They seriously need to make a movie based on Tokyo Tower of Terror. Obviously, Guardians of the Galaxy has the movies as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and the original Twilight Zone version has its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Terror_(1997_film)">own movie</a>. I wanna see Shikiri in a movie damn it! If you can make all those crappy Disney Channel Movies, then surely you can make a movie based on this!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="toystorymaniaTDS.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So the one ride I skipped due to crowds at Tokyo Disney was Toy Story Mania since....while I do love it, it's also something we have back at DCA. And it's SUPER popular here, and I just don't want to deal with waiting for it, or rushing to get a fastpass for it. Maybe if I spent 4 days. But yeah. Sorry, maybe next time.

So I wound up getting their Christmas special, since it was a really good deal. It was really good, particuarly that Vegtable Bacon Soup. But I don't think it was the best representation of Mexican food. But hey. Still really good.
</center>

</center>
<center>
Wow. Disney even managed to theme Old-School New York to Christmas!? Damn, these guys are good! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigbandbeat.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So I was highly recommended that I see Big Band Beat, which is basically a Mickey Mouse Jazz Show. Eh. It was good and all, but I wouldn't say it's a must-do when visiting Disneysea (Sorry Brandon).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Have I mentioned that I love that they just plopped a giant volcano into this park?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mermaidlagoon.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. Time to head back to Mermaid Lagoon.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mermaidlagoon5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP! They actually make this feel underwater! I love the theming down here! Gives me memories of the old Little Mermaid stuff I saw as a kid.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="whirlpool.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nothing special about these teacups. Well other than the fact that they're F*CKING UNDERWATER!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign700.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. One of the foods I remember hearing hype about from other trip reports was sea salt ice cream from Ariel's seashell. This isn't quite that, but it's close enough! And damn it! I want my ice cream!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="icecream20.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
So this is a Monaka, which is usually a pastery filled with red bean creme and goes with tea. But they also can be filled with ice cream. Like here. It's sea salt ice cream, with strawberry jam, in between two wafers. And DAMN!!!! SO GOOD!!! Seriously, Monakas need to catch on in America.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneysea12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's impossible to take a bad photograph at this park. It's that amazing.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="menu9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. Let's consume more food. This time, we're downing a Carmel Milk Cocktail with Coffee Jello.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol25.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not sure if I was recommended this from a friend, read about it from someone elses Photo TR, or how I found out about it. But it was good. It was basically a Starbucks drink, only it can get you drunk.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What comes after alcohol? ROLLER COASTER!!! =D 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hard to believe that the big roller coaster, while fun, isn't among the best rides here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ragingspirits8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fire! Fire always makes any roller coaster better! Just ask Six Flags! =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hell Yes! I want more rides on Sinbad!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Meow! You're not getting away from me asshole! I'm attacking you because I'm Chandu!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can we have this in the Middle East please? F*ck the hijab! I want this damn it!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage15.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Another thing worth noting about this ride. Remember when I compared it to Small World earlier? Well part of the reason is not only because it's a long dark ride with a bunch of animatronics as you travel across many places. But also, because they both have an INCREDIBLY catchy song. But unlike on Small World, you LIKE this earworm. Seriously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlfcDCCev24">Compass Of Your Heart</a> is AWESOME!!! Listening to that song right now as I make this update. I WANNA GO BACK TO DISNEYSEA!!! =(
</center>
	
<p>

<center>
"Meow! ALL the bananas are mine! I deserve them all! Why? Because I'm Chandu!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sinbadsstorybookvoyage17.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sinbad wishes everyone safe journeys and to check out his ride. I'd say it's criminally underrated, but recently, I've been hearing A LOT of people call this ride incredibly underrated and it's been getting A LOT more love recently. This makes me very happy.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="caravancarousel2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know I can't call it the best carousel ever because Cedar Downs exists, but this is seriously up there as far as carousels goes (Hmm. Top 10 Carousels List? Nah).
</center>

<center>
Now if you know me, you'll know that I RARELY buy park souviners. Prior to this, the last park souviner I bought was way back when I visited f*cking <a href="TPRCanobieLakePark.html">Canobie Lake Park</a>. But at Tokyo Disney, you just have to get something. And I thought "I love Chandu. I really love Chandu. You know what? I want my own Chandu!". So I went and bought one of these stuffed Chandus. And I love having a peice of Tokyo Disneysea in my room.

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fastpass10.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Oh look at the time. Our Journey fastpass is finally ready!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* If we're back at Tokyo Disneysea! Then...gotta have more Journey!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="journeytothecenteroftheearth7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. That bridge is actually the brake run for Journey to the Center of the Earth.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sscolumbia3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Perhaps I should've checked out the ship in greater detail. Perhaps check out one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Columbia_(Tokyo_DisneySea)">resteraunts</a> here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="towerofterrorTDS11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh Shikiri! Where are you!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn18.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, time for the last one. Popcorn Flavor #8. Garlic Shrimp.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcorn19.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly, I wasn't a huge fan of this one. I mean, yeah. That shouldn't be too surprising since....it's Garlic Shrimp Popcorn. It doesn't sound good. But...neither does Curry Popcorn or Soy Sauce & Butter Popcorn. And both of those are amazing. So I'm very saddened by the Garlic Shrimp popcorn having a...weird taste. Yeah. I won't get this again next time.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
And with all the Popcorns tried (The only ones we didn't get here were Salted and Carmel, since those two are just too similar to what you can get back home), I think it only is fair that we do a Top 8 List and rank all of the popcorn we tried. 
</center>
	
<p>	
<center>
Yeah, it feels wrong to put the Savory Popcorns and the Sweet Popcorns in the same list since...apples and oranges. But nevertheless, here's a mini in-update Top 8 List.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
TOP 8 POPCORN FLAVORS AT TOKYO DISNEY!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
#8. Garlic Shrimp
</center>
<center>
#7. Barbecue
</center>
<center>
#6. Honey
</center>
<center>
#5. Chocolate
</center>
<center>
#4. Strawberry
</center>
<center>
#3. Black Pepper
</center>
<center>
#2. Curry
</center>

</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtprometheus9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tokyo Disneysea. You are amazing and I can't wait to come back on my next Japan trip, which needs to happen SOON!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneyland2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, we're back at Tokyo Disneyland for the rest of the night.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds99.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think you understand that this park gets busy by now. I don't need anymore crowd photos in this update.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! A ride at Tokyo Disneyland that I haven't done and you can't do back home. Better check it out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, the Country Bear Jamboree is out celebrating Christmas along with the rest of Tokyo Disneyland.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know a lot of older people are still nostalgic from when this was back at Disneyland. Eh...It was good to ride something I can't do at home. But I'm not gonna pretend that I'm a big fan of this show.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This bear still hasn't gotten over the fact that they got rid of Country Bear Jamboree at Disneyland.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When Santa's reindeer misbehaves, he decapitates them and hangs them on his wall. >=)

<p>
<center>
  <img src="countrybearjamboree6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. We forgot to mention that we wish you a Happy New Year (Oh yeah. 2019 is already halfway over. Hopefully the Happy New Year actually came to fruition).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="splashmtnTDL3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is it a smart idea to ride Splash Mountain at night? Do you seriously us to make smart decisions?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign701.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sure. We'll give you a canoe here. We trust people way more here than we do at the other Disney Parks.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="marktwainriverboatTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. The Mark Twain River Boat is here too.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not the biggest Jungle Cruise fan, but hey. Might as well check out Japanese Jungle Cruise to see if there's anything different here. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture178.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hippos are big boy animals! They don't need no stinkin' humans brushing their teeth for them! =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm really happy I did this, as Jungle Cruise here is so much better! Who would've guessed that Jungle Cruise would've been the biggest surprise of Tokyo Disney?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This Jungle Cruise has a couple bonus parts that you don't get in the California (and presumably Florida) Jungle Cruise.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This baby elephant isn't just bathing in the jungle! No bitch! You bring me a pink strobe light! I gotta be fancy in this jungle!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Worst loss of virginity ever. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, we've all seen the backside of water. But when are we gonna get that sweet side-water?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglecruiseTDL6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For instance, on Japanese Jungle Cruise, your boat actually go into a temple, and....you get an intersting light show in there.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="waffle4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. The final thing recommended to me foodwise (Well, not really. But I didn't get around to the other recommendations) were the Mickey Waffles.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign702.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Just in case you don't know how to make a food as easy as waffles.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="waffle5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Black Pepper Teriyaki Chicken Roll for Breakfast. Strawberry Mickey Waffles for Dinner. Sounds right to me.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="madteapartyTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I saw all the parades and shows yesterday. So I figured, I might as well check out the Fantasyland dark rides now since now's the time they all have a short line.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="smallworldTDL9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may not be the biggest Small World fan, but the light package it has is always great.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="pinnochioTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now there's a ride I haven't ridden in forever.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="pinnochioTDL2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see that smile that just screams "I'm gonna sell these kids into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPDN9CwhhAM">slavery</a>" on you Coachman.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="snowwhiteTDL.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know its weird comparing Fantasyland Dark Rides, but Tokyo Snow White somehow has an even more abrupt ending than the California version.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One upside about all the night parades. All the Fantasyland dark rides get short lines, that means MORE POOH RIDES!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love Fantasyland at night.
</center>
	
<p>

<center>
"Psst. Hey Pooh. Take this balloon so you can fly and avoid TS...Oh wait. There is no TSA in Japan. Never mind."
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HEY POOH! QUIT SPYING ON ME!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt13.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Psychadelic Dream Part of Pooh's Hunny Hunt.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poohshunnyhunt15.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But I don't want it to be "The End". =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacemtnTDL9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Last ride at Tokyo Disneyland. But hey. Closing out on Space Mountian is pretty cool.
</center>
	
	<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneyland3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is amazing.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture179.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I seriously miss Pooh's Hunny Hunt. =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyodisneylandhotel.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Again, I never stayed there. But the Tokyo Disneyland hotel does look really cool.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue75.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Tokyo Disney Resort is simply amazing. Without a doubt my favorite theme park, my favorite Disney property, and I just can't say enough good things about this place. 3 days is not enough! And considering all the stuff they've got under construction, there's gonna be even more cool stuff to check out. Well, at least I have a couple more days of Japan left. So that's gonna be fun.
