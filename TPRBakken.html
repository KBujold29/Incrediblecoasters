<center>
Well, the bonuses are over and the trip has officially begun. Time to head on the bus to our first park (lovely view of Copenhagen).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakken.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay!!! We made it!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakken2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bakken is reportedly one of the oldest amusement parks in the world, dating all the way back to 1583. Yeah, this park is almost twice as old as the United States. Just let that sink in for a moment.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's get ERT started with Rutschebahn. One of only 5 Scenic Railways left in the world.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First up, we went to the secret maintanence area for a history lesson on the roller coaster, which was very interesting.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Enough History!! Let's ride!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love the funky non-straight lifthill. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now for some bad news about the ride. A couple years ago, they got rid of the original cars with the brakeman you saw in the maintanence area for newer cars with automatic braking, which sort of neutered the ride. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, at least the new cars look nice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, at least they still kept this, which made me very happy. I know some of my American Friends were quite surprised to hear about this (and this isn't even the most f*cked up thing on the trip). =) 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rutschebanen8.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, its still a fun ride, even if I was told it used to be much better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoBAKKEN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Rutschebahn may be a historical classic, but this is without a doubt, the star attraction of the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoBAKKEN2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Do NOT underestimate Tornado. It'll kick your ass and karate chop your neck if you don't brace in time. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoBAKKEN3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really hope Intamin builds more spinners like this cause it's insane.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="santa.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! I found Santa Claus!! Don't bother going to the North Pole in the middle of the Arctic Ocean. Just head on over to Bakken.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="carouselBAKKEN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let me on the Teacup Carousel!! I have such a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-1TR43QuO0">great history</a> with these things!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildemus.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets get the other credits, starting out with the low capacity Wild Mouse. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildemus2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
D'oh!! Everyone else stole our idea!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildemus3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not a bad Wild Mouse, but I've also ridden better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vildemus4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wee!!! Cha-Ching!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="caesars.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Caesar. How much to eat at your resteraunt?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="racing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Continuing on with getting credits, we're now onto Racing, which is basically just outdoors Space Mountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="racing2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why is this ride called Racing if you're not racing anybody? Are we just racing the other cars on the track?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="racing3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
RACE FASTER CAESAR!!! I'M CATCHING UP!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="racing4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But in all seriousness, it was a fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minetrainulven.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Onto Mine Train Ulven, which is basically just outdoors Skull Mountain. Geez, Outdoor Space Mountain, Outdoor Skull Mountain, I think I'm sensing a trend here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minetrainulven2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it was a really good ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakken3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In case you forgot, Bakken also serves as a local park for those living on the outskirts of Copenhagen.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="mariehonen.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one last credit for us to get.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mariehonen2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's right. It's sad and pathetic time over here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mariehonen3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we got the credit. Cha-Ching!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skyroller.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, time to get on the most intersting flat ride in the park. Sky Roller.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skyroller2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This thing has to be the most frustrating ride ever!! I kept trying to get it to flip, but I couldn't get the weight right. It's not like Brain Surge or the 2 person Top Spin where you just let all hell break loose. You gotta get it just right, and I couldn't get the hang of it. Ugh. I need more practice with this ride. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'm in Europe all right.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for lunch. Lunch was good and...what's that? YES!!! EUROPEAN FANTA IS BACK!!!! Ok, that's actually Miranda, the Pepsi version of European Fanta, but still!!! European Miranda Knock Off > American Fanta!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dessert3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why yes. I would like dessert as well. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waffle2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I am determined to eat a waffle at every single park on this trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="desperadoBAKKEN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time to ride Desperado (the 3D Shooter, not the Arrow Hyper).
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="desperadoBAKKEN2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No need to aim or even keep my eyes open. Just use the force and the targets will come to me." 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="5Dtheater.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on now. Let's go see the 5D Show!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="5Dtheater2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
So we're gonna see a show about going to an island inhabited with dinosaurs that you brought back from the dead. Gee, if only someone had been smart enough to make a movie based off that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="clown2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Brooke's favorite park mascot ever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vandrulschebahn.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The log ride was fun and all, but the water quality...not the best to say the least.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="extremeBAKKEN2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were told to come back to Extreme at 3:30 for a special.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="extremeBAKKEN.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!! THIS THING WAS HAULING ASS!!! I mean, it was all right before, but with the operators giving us their special ride, this went from fun to even better than Tango.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No. A roller coaster does not go through my vagina. Now quit staring."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="simulator2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
BEST SIMULATOR EVER!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign322.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So glad they have this single riders line so I can get more rides in on Tornado.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bakken4.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Well, I had a great time at Bakken. Thanks for everything.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="partybus7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
European Bus Drivers are scarily good at their jobs. I mean, just look at how much room we're squeezing by in!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now, time for the most insane part of the day. The Ropes Course.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See how big the building is, yeah. That's how high off the ground we're gonna be. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign323.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There was a Heavy Metal Festival, Copenhell going on right next door. I wouldv'e joined them if I wasn't doing the Ropes Course instead.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. For the sake of everyone around you. Please take a dump before you jump.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one of the many obstacles to go through on the Ropes Course. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This shows you just how high off the ground you are. It's 50 meters (164 ft) above the ground.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oops. Sorry about that. Thought you were a spider after hearing all about you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ropescourse7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Once you're done with the Ropes Course, you take the series of Ziplines to get down. I really recommend doing this when you're in Copenhagen. It's an amazing experience.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The dinner they served us may not be anything fancy, but it was a good sandwich.
