You know you're in the midwest when you wake up to this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTURELAND.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. We have definetly arrived at Adventureland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tantrum.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Look!!! They have a <a href="DrVonDarksTunnelofTerrorPhotos.html">Dr. Von Dark</a> clone here!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So far, this seems like a nice little park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I know I've seen something like this before. I just can't figure out where.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They've got a nice Main Street here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, half of Main Street has been reduced to dirt since that fire earlier. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign131.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But don't worry. They can rebuild it. They have the technology. Main Street will be better than ever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This park is really really beautiful.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="popcornpig.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If the popcorn comes from the pig, then does that mean that they have Bacon popcorn?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sillysilo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. I miss Spin Out. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTURELAND2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to ride woodie #1 of the trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTUERLAND3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yup. There's corn on the other side of the lifthill. We're in the midwest.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTURELAND4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This better be good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTURELAND5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news is that Tornado is actually a really good woodie.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoADVENTURELAND6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it's not mindblowing or anything, it's still a very fun and enjoyable ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragon.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike this evil evil contraption.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragon2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As much as I hate to say it, I have found a coaster that is even worse than <a href="WildBeastPhotos.html">Wild Beast.</a> (Previously, the worst coaster ridden by Incrediblecoasters.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragon3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We haven't even reached the lifthill and Dragon has already beaten the living crap out of me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragon4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is so horrible it's giving me flashbacks of my encounter with Satan.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragon5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm suprised that nobody has fractured their skulls on this thing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonmirror.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is what you look like after going through the Dragon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sawmillsplash.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really wanted to do this.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sawmillsplash2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, the people I was with bailed out on me and later in the day, it had an hour long line. =( 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sidewinderADVENTURELAND.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This frisbee actually runs a pretty good program. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="outlaw.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for the other woodie. The Outlaw.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign132.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. But I just got here. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="outlaw2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And like Tornado, it was actually really fun. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="outlaw3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be a beautiful masterpiece like Maverick, but hey. At least you're not getting brain damage like on Dragon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="underground.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, next up was the Underground. People usually claim this to be the 4th credit at Adventureland. However, my gut is telling me that this is a dark ride and that it doesn't count as a credit. It's in my credit count for now. But don't be suprised if in the future, I decide to remove the Underground from my credit count.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign133.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wow. They must take graffiti very seriously here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grafitti2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. Well, at least the graffiti here is nice wheras in California, graffiti is either A: "I'm going to write F*ck all over the wall because people are offended by it. HA HA HA! Look how cool I am." Or B: "I'm going to draw a giant dick on the wall because people are offended by it. HA HA HA! Look how cool I am."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="underground2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Credit or not, this is a pretty cool and bizzare ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gforce.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After being dissapointed with California's Great America's breakdance, I had low expectations, but this thing was hauling ass!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign134.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We have our own spot because we're special.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is a nice break from traditional park food.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spaceshot.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Not only can you feel the wind in your face on this space shot, but it's also not closing on Labor Day. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="splashover.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The top spin here at Adventureland actually runs a really good program. It's very Windsurf like.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="inverter.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Inverter = Epic Win.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fish5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
MINE MINE MINE!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="outlaw4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One last ride on Outlaw before we must head on out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="adventureland6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm gonna miss this place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="desmoines.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And in case you couldn't tell, that is indeed the city of Des Moines. (You can tell because otherwise, you'd just see corn.)
