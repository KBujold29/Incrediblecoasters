All right. Day 2 of the trip begins with a very interesting drive through New York City.
</center>

If you're going to litter, just make sure you don't do it from 9:30 - 11:00 AM on Tuesdays.

<center>
YAY!!!!!! WE MADE IT TO CONEY ISLAND!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I know they have a very famous roller coaster over at Coney Island. But I just can't put my finger on it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I know they've tried to clone it everywhere, but could never come quite close to the original, but I still can't figure it out. Does it have to do with chicken?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh I know!!!! It's that new Volare!!!!! It quickly rose up as one of the most famous and historical coasters of all times!!! (In case you're too stupid to figure this out, I'm making sh*t up here. It's so obviously the Coney Island Cyclone.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Coney Island Cyclone is a very interesting ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's got nice laterals and some really crazy pops of ejector air. But it really does beat the living crap out of you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cyclone6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Have fun you guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="denoswonderwheel.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aside from the Coney Island Cyclone, Coney Island has one other famous attraction. Deno's Wonder Wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="denoswonderwheel2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly not. Truely a shame that Mickey's Fun Wheel is the ONLY other swinging Ferris Wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="denoswonderwheel3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Only the cool people take the swinging cars. (Oh wait, never mind. None of us are cool.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="denoswonderwheel4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Robin!!! Where are you? We need you to come ride the Wonder Wheel with us please!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supershot.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, their Shock Drop is awesome!!! Much better than the one at Scandia.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spookorama.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They've also got Spookorama, which is an interesting dark ride to say the least.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spookorama2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What the f*ck is this ride about?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spookorama3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Do you think any of those guys saw Zookeeper?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grandma.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Are you my mother?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaserpent.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Up next, would be Sea Serpent. Our first kiddy coaster of the day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaserpent2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, for a kiddy coaster, it was actually decent. Better than both of yesterdays kiddie coasters.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaserpent3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
NERD!!!!!!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soaringeagle.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh boy. Another Volare.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soaringeagle2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I had really liked Time Warp @ Canada's Wonderland, so I was hoping this would be just as good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soaringeagle3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And it was. Every good thing I said in my <a href="TimeWarpPhotos.html">Time Warp Review</a> applies here. In fact, this one may actually be even better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soaringeagle4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That is some of the best hangtime ever!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steeplechase.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next is a modern take on a Coney Island Classic, the Steeplechase.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steeplechase2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We love these horses. They will soon become some of the finest glue around.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steeplechase3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude! This ride kicks Pony Express's ass, and then sh*ts on it's corpse!!! It's actually fun, got a decent layout, and some good laterals as well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="asspuke.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Nick, what would this be called in Paramedic Talk?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nathans.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and they also have the Original Famous Nathans here. And considering how much I loved the chain, going to the original was pretty sweet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nathans2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Best hot dog I've had in my life. Nuff said.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="newyorkcity8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just in case you forgot where we were.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign187.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Whoops. Looks like we stumbled onto the X-Rated Coney Island. Well, at least we know where Ceaser is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tickler.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Up next, we took a spin on the Tickler.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tickler2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tickler was an awesome spinning mouse since unlike most other spinning mice, this one spins throughout the whole course instead of just in the 2nd Half.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tickler3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like only one of you guys is Ticklish.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildriverCONEYISLAND.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*Sniff* I miss Wild Rivers. Once again, I would just like to say "F*CK YOU IRVINE COMP!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="circuscoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The final credit we need at Coney Island.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="circuscoaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. It's just yet another Kiddy Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="circuscoaster3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though it was a really good kiddy coaster, it was still a kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="circuscoaster4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You filthy filthy credit whores.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coneyislandsound.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now that we got all the credits here, we can check out the flat rides at Coney Island. This bouncy bouncy ride was fun and all...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="airrace.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But Air Race was without a doubt, the star flat ride. This was seriously an awesome flat ride. It has great laterals due to it's fast spinning, flips alot, and is just an awesome awesome ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zam.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love drop towers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="eclipse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These frisbees may be small, but man do they pack a punch. Much better than some of the bigger ones.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="brooklynflyer.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I also rode my first Starflyer at Coney Island. While it was one of the small models, I still really liked it. While it didn't really scare me, I still really liked it and am hoping to try out the much bigger ones.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="saturnsix.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I had heard lots of good things about Saturn 6, so I ventured off on my own to give it a try. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="saturnsix2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a fun flat ride and all, but it wasn't worth the $6.00. Air Race and Brooklyn Flyer were much better flats anyway. But hey, it's still cheaper than f*cking Rockit at the Ventura County Fair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfsup.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were definetly too big for this Stand Up Rocking Tug as we broke it and feared that we would miss the bus by not getting off the ride in time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign188.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"This sign makes my brain hurt."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="comingoutparty.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Later that night, we had a coming out party for Piers, because Piers being gay was such a shock. I know several people who should we should totally throw a coming out party for. *cough* Jersy *cough*
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, you can't have a party for Peirs without having LOTS and LOTS of alcohol. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Something terrible has happened!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alcohol3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I'm gonna puke all over the bus tomorrow."
