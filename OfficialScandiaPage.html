Scandia is not the kind of park that most people would've had high expectations for. It may have been in Southern California, but I procrastinated so much in getting here that I ended up coming here in 2011 for credit whoring. My plan was just to get the credits, maybe try another ride or two, and then move on. But nope, I really enjoyed Scandia. This was a fantastic little park. Yeah, it totally had a Golf'N'Stuff feel to the place where everything is cheap and its mostly just for locals and whores. But no. This place was really freaking fun. In fact, we stopped here every single year for a while. All of the stuff here was insane. It may not have looked crazy, but it was crazy. Scandia Screamer, Crazy. Cliff Jumper, Crazy. Bumper Boats, Crazy. Gravitron, Crazy. Those are not just an ordinary roller coaster, or an ordinary drop tower, or ordinary bumper boats, or an ordinary gravitron. IT WAS ALL INSANE!!!! (OK, the drop tower, bumper cars, and gravitron were fairly standard, but DUDE!!! I HAD A BLAST WITH IT!!) And that's what we loved about this place. It's just a great place to have a great time for a fun night. It was fairly out of the way in Southern California. So it wasn't exactly something you could just easily hit up along the way to Disneyland or Six Flags Magic Mountain. But hey. If you were a credit whore, or just want to go to a crazy little small park, Scandia would've been recommended.

All right. Here are all of the flat rides that were found at Scandia. All right, lets start off with their drop tower. Cliff Jumper. First off, I LOVED the theme of this drop tower. Anything themed after cliff jumping has to be awesome. And as for the drop tower itself, it was really damn good. It was a Shock Drop, which means that you have no idea when its going to drop. You just climb up and immedietly drop when you get to the top, making it a very fun drop tower for its size and it packs quite a powerful punch. Shock Drops are really good. They also had a Screamin Swing here. Yeah, it was a small model, but it wasn't an upcharge. =) I was told in advance that it ran a sh*tty program, but it ran GREAT for me. It felt like it was nearly going to flip. And then of course, there was the Gravitron. HOLY CRAP!!! THIS THING WAS BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS INSANE!!! There were no rules inside, you could do whatever you want. We were riding it sideways, upsidedown, rolling across the walls, kids were running around, we made a human bridge for them to run under, and they sometimes played Smash Mouth Videos during the ride. Yeah. This thing was freaking awesome. I wish all Gravitrons were that fun. They also had a tilt a whirl, a pirate ship, a scrambler, and a slide.

There was only one water ride at Scandia. The Bumper Boats. Now I know that bumper boats are SUPER EASY TO SKIP!!!! And I mean SUPER EASY!!!!! It's almost second nature to do so. But with every rule comes an exception. This was the exception to that rule. THESE THINGS WERE FREAKING AMAZING!!!!! They had water guns on the boats so you're constantly shooting other people. The boats are hard to steer so you'll be stuck and you'll all be spraying each other. And look out for the waterfall, you're likely to get pushed under it. OK, it was nothing special. But you know what? F*ck it! I had a blast! Maybe I should try the bumper boats at other parks.

You're likely to end up just like this poor woman and be the target for everyone else.

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff that was at Scandia. Now when it comes to theming, there was pretty much none at Scandia. The theming at Scandia was pretty much the equivelant to the theming at your local Golf'N'Stuff style place. Which is basically saying, there was no theming here. Now as for other stuff to do, there are options. Well, of course, they do have mini golf. It actually was a lot of fun. The course was cool. Now like all Golf'N'Stuff style places, they do indeed have an arcade. But what I definetly found most intersting are the Go-Karts. Yep, they have Go-Karts here. While thats not totally original as many Golf'N'Stuff places have Go-Karts, but hey. They are fun, provided the stupid kids aren't rear-ending you Mt. Olympus style.

Scandia was a fun little park with a lot of crazy things to do. From a far, it seemed like a boring little credit whoring stop. But once you got inside and try everything for yourself, it was all crazy and a ton of fun. It was far from one of the best theme parks in the world. Not even close, but they had a lot of fun stuff to do. Scandia Screamer was a fun little coaster (Fingers crossed that it finds a new home), the bumper boats were insane, and the gravitron was insane. Everything here was basically just insane. I wouldn't have really gone out of the way for it, but if you were in the area, into credit whoring, or just wanted to check out a crazy underrated coaster, then Scandia would've been recommended
