After all the fun that we had at Quassy, it was time to head over to Lake Compounce to have even more fun. 
</center>

<center>
This park totally reminds of Kennywood. In just about every single way.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Both parks have one signature amazing Top 10 Coaster, both parks have a nice flat ride collection, combinding old classic flats with cool new modern flats, and both have a really nice atmosphere, rich in history.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="potatopatch3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They both even have Potato Patch Fries. Yeah. I love this park already. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zoomerang.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Lets just get this out of the way as quickly as possible.  
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zoomerang2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, at least this was one of the better Boomerangs. 
</center>

"It's at times like this when I really wonder if credit whoring is even worth it."

</center>
<center>
I'm not sure what we're riding next, but we better call Dan and tell him to get his ass on this ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sawmillplunge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This log flume had a really nice setting.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
"I can't believe I got wet on a water ride!!!! Next you'll be telling me you actually pigs don't fly!!!" 
</center>

<center>
Oh, and like Holiday World, Lake Compounce also gives out free drinks. THANK YOU LAKE COMPOUNCE!!!! YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to check out what is claimed as one of the greatest wooden coasters of all time. Boulderdash.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The setting on this ride kicks ass!!! This looks more like a cliff jumping spot than an amusement park. So that alone makes it pretty damn cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And it turns out all that hype is indeed correct. BOULDERDASH IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
I hope you like S&S Towers because you're going to be seeing A LOT of them in this update. So get used to them. 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
"Hey guys!!! How's it going!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildcatLC.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, after Boulderdash, this is gonna be sh*t. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildcatLC2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And it was. Even if Boulderdash wasn't here, it'd still be a crappy wooden coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wildcatLC3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey. A credit's a credit. No matter how sh*tty." =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anchorbay.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The water park here actually looks nice. Too bad I didn't have time to check it out. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lakeplunge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! Those slides literally plop you right in Lake Compounce!!! That's just awesome!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderrapids.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I heard that Piers and Britney had some fun on the rapids ride. Care to reenact that moment for us please?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lake Compounce served us an awesome dinner with a lot more variety than just typical amusement park crap such as a burrito bar, mac & cheese, ribs, and lots more.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We simply have to ride Boulderdash some more. It's that good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
INot suprised in the least about that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those hills right there have some really really crazy ejector air. DO NOT underestimate those hills.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Basically, the best way for me to describe Boulderdash is that it's like what the Beast SHOULD be like, but is not, because that rides lame and this rides awesome.
</center>

<p>

"Come on Antonio!!! Get your ass on the enterprise!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthunt.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to check out their Shooting Dark Ride since we lots of time and everything in this park is worth checking out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthunt2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Watch out for these statues. They spit water at you when you least expect it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthunt3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Looks like your typical Sally Shooting Dark Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthunt4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though I'd definetly give this the award for hardest shooting dark ride ever!!!! It is physically impossible to hit these targets!!! I only hit ONE THING during the entire ride!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thundernlightning.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Screaming Swings are always fun, though this one was a little on the short side. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoLC.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We had a spinning contest on the Tornado here to see who could spin theirs the fastest. Yeah, that made for an insane ride. And I forgot who won.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americanflyers.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! They have flyers here as well!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americanflyers2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, they too, were unsnappable. LAME!!!!!!!!! =(
</center>

<p>

  <img src="zoomersgasngo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I wish I had a car as cool as this, but unfortunetly, I don't even have a car at all. Yeah yeah, I know. I'm such a bad Californian."
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
New at Lake Compounce this year, was their Disko, Revolution. It was fun and ran a good program.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kiddycoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Right when the park closed, Lake Compounce opened up the kiddy coaster for us sad and pathetic credit whores.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kiddycoaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!!! I am proud of my credit whoring and you should be too!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!!! Now we get to have Boulderdash ERT!!!! And let met tell you, this thing is a f*cking BEAST at night!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash9.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In fact, Boulderdash is so good that it officially replaced Coaster as the #1 woodie of all time on Incrediblecoasters!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boulderdash10.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This was an insane ERT session.
