Cedar Point is without a doubt, one of the most famous parks in the world. Even if you're not a roller coaster enthusiast, you have probably heard about Cedar Point due to how often it appears on the Discovery and Travel Channel. So you obviously know that is a good amusement park to go to. And yes, that is true. Cedar Point is a very nice park to visit. They have a bunch of roller coasters to ride as well as a lot of other coasters for you to ride. Now you probably are thinking of Cedar Point's main big attractions such as Top Thrill Dragster, Millenium Force, Maverick, and now Steel Vengeance. And yes, those are all very fun rides (Especially the last two). But there are also many other rollercoasters and other general rides for you to ride in the park. As well as good rides, the park has a great setting right by Lake Erie. And if you're worried about crowds when at Cedar Point, we've got some good news. The lines here move REALLY FREAKING FAST!!!!!! Plus, there's always Fast Lane if you really want to do everything in one day. However, the park does have a couple flaws such as it's idiotic rain policy despite it's flawless apperiance that it gets from television and the rest of the roller coaster community. However, despite it being overrated (that just naturally comes with a large amount of hype), it is still a fantastic amusement park and I would, like most enthusiasts, recommend it to any coaster enthusiast. I mean, after all, it is the roller coaster capital of the world. I'm definetly looking foreword to coming back here again and enjoying all the cool rides. Especially Maverick & Steel Vengeance.

Here are the reviews of all the Flat Rides at Cedar Point. Unlike another <a href="OfficialSixFlagsMagicMountainPage.html">certain rival park,</a> Cedar Point is doing a fantastic job in both the roller coaster department and the flat ride department. Cedar Point has got all sorts of flat rides, ranging from giant modern flat rides all the way to quirky 70s flat rides. So there's a lot of flat rides to go over here. The first flat ride I'll be reviewing for you would be MaXair. Now MaXair is one of those Giant Huss Frissbees. And let me tell you something about Giant Huss Frisbees. THEY ARE FAST!!!! They're so fast you barely notice the lack of spin it has. But nobody cares. These rides are awesome. While it's sad that Huss isn't making them anymore, Zamperla has come in to fill the gap. So that's good/ Next up, there's the Power Tower. This is an S&S Quad Tower, with two Space Shots and two drop towers. And it is pretty big. So that's the good news. Not too much else, it's the standard S&S Tower, though the view is fantastic. Another really awesome flat ride that I have to talk about would be Skyhawk. Skyhawk would be a Screaming Swing. These rides are really funThe final flat ride that I rode while at Cedar Point would be the Derby Racer. Now the Derby Racer is a very unique flat ride that most parks don't have anymore. If you can imagine what a carousel that smoked some crack would be like, you're probably thinking of Derby Racer. I'd highly recommend riding Derby Racer if at Cedar Point. I usually doesn't have that long of a line, and you can find clones of MaXair and Skyhawk at other parks. But Cedar Downs is the only one of its kind in the world. Oh, and they also have a Windseeker. Now you know that I am no fan of these rides. But the location definetly makes this the best of the three that I rode. For a while, Cedar Point had another drop ride known as Demon Drop, which was an Intamin 1st Generation Freefall, and as you know, those are awesome. But in 2009, Demon Drop left Cedar Point. But luckily, it is still operating at <a href="OfficialDorneyParkPage.html">Dorney Park.</a> Cedar Point, like so many Cedar Fair Parks, also got a Windseeker. The one at Knotts was fun, but nothing special. I'm assuming its the same at Cedar Point. Cedar Point is also home to a Chaos, an Enterprise, a Chairswings, and many other 70s style flat rides. So as you can see, Cedar Point is doing a fantastic job in the flat ride department.

While I never rode any water rides at Cedar Point due to the foggy wather and all the other stuff to do, Cedar Point does have a good water ride collection. Their first water ride, Snake River Falls is a giant Shoot the Chutes Water Ride. It's basically a clone of White Water Landing at <a href="OfficialDorneyParkPage.html">Dorney Park.</a> So it's a really fun ride that will get you VERY WET!!!!!! They've also got a river rapids ride called Thunder Canyon. I never even saw it during my visit to Cedar Point, but it sounds like fun on a hot day. And that's all that the park has for water rides. Not bad.

While this water park isn't technically part of Cedar Point due to seperate admission, its pretty much adjacent and part of the park. I never visited Soak City, but it does look fun. And looking at the park now compared to 10 years ago, it definetly looks like it got a huge upgrade and might be worth a visit sometime.

While Cedar Point is doing a phenomenal job in the rollercoaster department, a very good job in the flat ride department, and a good job in the water ride department, when it comes to Dining, Cedar Point is...decent. I mean, it's not phenomenal. It's not anywhere near on the same level as a place like <a href="OfficialDollywoodPage.html">Dollywood</a> or <a href="OfficialSilverDollarCityPage.html">Silver Dollar City</a>. But at the same time, it does seem to have more than the average theme park. Particuarly, I notice a lot more full service sit down resteraunts. By far, the place most worth mentioning would be a sit down resteraunt called Melt. This resteraunt is all about cheese. All the food is supposed to be as cheesy as possible, and yeah. It's really good. Plus, the service was fantastic. So I highly reommend this resteraunt. They also have a Famous Dave's right outside the park. It's a really good BBQ place, but it's also a chain, so you can eat at a Famous Dave's nearby, and not have to go to Cedar Point. But that's no fun. And because food festivals are now a thing, I happened to be at Cedar Point during the Brew & BBQ Festival. So yeah. You pay $20, and you get a ton of beer & BBQ. And it's all good. It's super good. I mean, they had limited time beers for Rougarou & Valravn. I really wish they made those permanent! A Cedar Point staple! Yeah! I want that!

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Cedar Point. As far as theming goes, Cedar Point doesn't provide too much. There are some skeletons on the train ride, some western theming by Maverick and Steel Vengeance, but there's really not that much theming in the park. But the park really has a kickass setting right by the shore of Lake Erie. I did manage to meet Jerry from Ben & Jerry's Ice cream at a shopein the front of the park. While I'm sure Cedar Point has some cool shows or other activities to do, but I never did any of them, because that wasn't my focus when I visited the park. I spent most of my time trying to get in all of the rollercoasters. I'm sure that if Cedar Point was my home park, I could give you a full blown list of other stuff to do. But really, at Cedar Point, it's all about the Roller Coasters.

<font color="#00FF00">
Cedar Point is a completely awesome theme park to visit. As well as outstanding rollercoasters to ride such as Maverick and Steel Vengeance, there are some unique flat rides such as Derby Downs, some good water rides to cool off with, as well as a LOT more rides for everyone to enjoy. They have so much to do at Cedar Point that 2 days is not enough time to get everything done (unless you get the Fast Lane, which I highly recommend). And while the park does get very crowded during the summer, the lines move very fast, so it's not a living hell waiting in them like you'd expect it to be (As long as it doesn't rain). Despite what the Discovory and Travel Channel say, the park does have it's flaws such as it's rain policy and other minor nitpicks, but aside from those things, this park is totally awesome. I'd recommend Cedar Point to any coaster enthusiast (Well, I'm sure most enthusiasts dream about Cedar Point based on what the Discovory and Travel Channel says about them).
