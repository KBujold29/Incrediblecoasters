<center>
We are driving to Napa because my mom forgot the key to the Halsteds House. Napa was nice exept for our Smokey Hotel room. OH MY GOD! YUCK! It smelled awful!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sfmw.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Yay! I finally made it to Six Flags Marine World!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2c.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I decided to do V2 because it was open.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zonga.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike Zonga which was closed all day.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2b.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I am really excited about my first Intamin Impulse ride!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="penguin.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
This penguin is really cute, but we went to SFMW for V2 and Medusa. We were going to see the Shouka show, but we didn't have time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I finally made it to another B&M!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa4.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Its reminds me of a certain blue parking lot coaster back at home.
</center>

<p>
<center>
   <img src="roadrunnerexpress.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Roadrunner Express was a really boring and uncomfortable kiddy coaster!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roar.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Yay! Roar woke up from its moring technical difficulties!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roar2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center> 
It wasn't as good as Ghostrider at KBF or Giant Dipper at the SCBB, but it was better than Collosus and ESPEACIALLY Psyclone! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2d.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Lets do V2 some more.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa5.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
This snake house houses Medusas station and Medusas Gum Wall! OH MY GOD!!! SICK!!!! But thats nothing compared to whats coming up!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I love the speed on the smooth Medusa.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kong4.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I hope the SLC doesn't hurt too much.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kong.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
You know, for a Vekoma SLC, it was running really good! About as good as Viper
on a good day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tasamaniandevil.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
  Tasamanian Devil. While it's much better than Knotts La Revelution, it's not as good as the fairs Xtreme though.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerangsfmw.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I am happy to report this Boomerang is WAY smoother than Knotts. I am unhappy to report that the crew running it was the rudest and laziest crew i've ever seen operate any ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="voodoo.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Voodoo is SFMWs Top Spin. I would have loved if the restraints wern't so tight and it was longer. After this and Knotts Riptide, I'm not the biggest Top Spin fan.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jambo.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Celeste! Its a Falling Star! Its like Twister at the fair! Want to ride?
</center>

<p>
<center>
   <img src="sfmwback.jpg">
</center>
<center>
The back of Six Flags Marine World actually looks NICE?!?!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hammerhead2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
No, Hammerhead does NOT have you fall uncomfortably into the restraints.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hammerhead.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I can't belive I skipped the one in Paris for what I thought at the time a credit and then realized its not a credit!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roar3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I decided to do the GCI again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
We got more rides on V2 today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="V2a.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
V2 RULES!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
   <img src="cobra.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Cobra was a better kiddy coaster. It was like Jaguar, only smaller.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kong2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Heres a shot of Kong going up the lifthill.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kong3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
It beat us up alot more than when we rode earlier.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
B&M Heartline Spins are always fun!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="medusa6.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Heres a shot of Medusas Loop and Heartline Spin before the SFMW part of the update is over.
</center>

</center>
<center>
At the Halsteds house, Celeste and Tara camp out in the backyard.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="swing.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Our villa in Tahoe had this swingset. The hotel wasn't as nice as Palm Springs, but it was still nice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tahoe.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
My mom is really enjoying her time in Lake Tahoe.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Allie, Trevor and Torin dig a really big hole!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="meltedsnow.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure about swimming in a lake of melted snow. Raccoons pee in the snow in the winter!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="exercise.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
We have to go exercise to burn off all of our theme park food carbs.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
5 seconds after this photo was taken, a car came! (We got out of the way though.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="olympics.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>

I think the Olympics was here in 1964.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseback.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
We are all ready to go horseback riding!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseback2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>

<center>
Horse, Make this ride exciting! I've already been spoiled by Medusa and V2.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseback4.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I want to ride the horse named Pokey because it reminds me of Gumby.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseback5.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Lets have fun Horseback riding!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="horseback3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riverrat.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I'm alone in the Trukee River where I found Trukee Rivers Gum Bridge! OH MY GOD!!! YUCK!!!! First Revolutions Gum Seat, Then Medusas Gum Wall, and Now THIS!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="caughtup.jpg" width="640" height="481" />

</center>
<center>
We are trying to Kayak into Nevada. (We failed though.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
The Argends say that this is the best restraunt in Tahoe, so we went here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
HEY! This doesn't look like a Sunnyside, It looks like SFMMs Mooseburger Lodge!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Here's the Sunny Side of Sunnyside.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside4.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
So the sign says that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside5.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside7.jpg" width="640" height="481" />

The sunny side of Sunnyside won't be sunny for long.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sunnyside8.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Heres a photo of the food here. This is a REALLY good restraunt. Not as good as Mikados, but still really good.
