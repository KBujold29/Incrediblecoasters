The reason we are not growing antler ears from the high G Forces is that antler ears are now considered cool annd we could never let that happen.

Another set of victims climb up to their deaths.

Well, There goes any chance of me passing Geomotry.

<center>
You know, It's actually not so painful if you just imagine shattering very expensive China Plates.

Just Imagine, In a year, On DejaVu, You'll literaly fly right over Thomas Town and everything in it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dejavu16.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
Seriously, They wouldn't put Thomas Town here. If they did that, What the hell would they call DejaVu? "The Little Plane that smoked just a little too much Crack?" I don't think so.
</center>
