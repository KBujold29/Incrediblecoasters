<center>
Your cadaverous pallor betrays an aura of foreboding, almost as though you sense a disquieting metamorphosis.Is this jump actually stretching, or is it your imagination?
</center>

Yeah. We decided to make a quick stop at Six Flags Magic Mountain. Because how else do you top off an awesome morning of cliff jumping than by riding X2.
</center>

What a great company this is. If you need money right now, just get a loan from these guys. Just scan now for fast approval. No need to check your credit score and make sure you're a responsible person who's financially responsible. We'll just give loans out like candy to everyone who walks by, regardless of if they're able to pay for them or not. Because activities like this have been absolutely WONDERFUL for our economy. Screw regulation, you want to get a loan, you got one. This is such a great company. And thank you Six Flags. Thank you for having such great and responsible companies represent your park.
