For today's review, we are heading to Fantasiland to review Montagne Russe. The park's crappy Galaxi-like coaster. The coaster is most likely closed. But for the sake of this review, let's just assume you found someone working the ride, bribed them, and they let you on the coaster. Hop in and off you go. Hope you pulled down your lapbar yourself. Cause they won't do it for you, nor will they test the coaster or any standard precautions. But meh, we'll be fine. You slowly roll around a turn before you begin to climb the lifthill. This lifthill seems kind of...sketchy. Yeah, that's right. It makes this weird sound. I wouldn't think twice about it if it wasn't for the fact that we just paid several hundred euros to ride a roller coaster that hasn't been ran in who knows how long. After you climb up the lifthill, you go through another slow turn. Then you head down the first drop. Its just a fun first drop, but nothing special. We then rise up a hill before we roll through another turn. It'd be nothing special, but on a coaster that looks incredibly flimsy and hasn't been tested, it keeps you on your toes. We move onto a small drop. Wee. We then rise up and head into an Italian Helix of Death. And considering how you're worried that this coaster might just completely collapse, it may literally be a helix of death (we'll be fine). We rise up a little hill before going through another turnaround. And hey, we have headchoppers. Please let the...they will. We then head down a small drop and gain a little speed. Crap!! We rise up and head into another turnaround into the brake run. It works! We survived! Hooray!!! Now tell me. Was that worth the â‚¬200? =)
