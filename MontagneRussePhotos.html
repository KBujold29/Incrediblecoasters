Does this ride still exist? Honestly, it's hard to tell given the history of this ride which.....Holy Crap! Long after I got this credit, wrote this review, I stopped paying attention to this ride since....it's a Galaxy at a crappy park. Who gives a f*ck. When I learned that this coaster was no longer at Fantasiland, I assumed it became scrap metal. However, this ride wound up going to some park called Gioylandia, in Naples, Italy. From what little I can find on this park (that I'm willing to research. I probably could learn more, but there's no reason for me to do so for a review of a crappy coaster that was at a ghetto park I once visited), it appears to be a permanent fair. Apparently, they also have a Wacky Worm. But it's not listed on RCDB because it's not a permanent installation. And it doesn't appear that that park has anything interesting. And it's not even at Gioylandia anymore either as it closed there too. But from my limited research (RCDB), they claim that they sold the coaster to some place in Russia. Not sure if this wound up at some random crappy park, to a carnival showman to travel at some crappy Russian fair (Don't think carnivals are the biggest priority of a country that's currently in the middle of attempting a medieval attrocious war crime invasion of their neighboring country). But regardless, we're reviewing it as it was back when it was at Fantasiland (now that park essentially has nothing). Go find the local guard, and bribe them to let you on. Hop in and off you go. Hope you pulled down your lapbar yourself. Cause they won't do it for you, nor will they test the coaster or any standard precautions. But meh, we'll be fine. You slowly roll around a turn before you begin to climb the lifthill. This lifthill seems kind of...sketchy. Yeah, that's right. It makes this weird sound. I wouldn't think twice about it if it wasn't for the fact that we just paid several hundred euros to ride a roller coaster that hasn't been ran in who knows how long. After you climb up the lifthill, you go through another slow turn. Then you head down the first drop. Its just a fun first drop, but nothing special. We then rise up a hill before we roll through another turn. It'd be nothing special, but on a coaster that looks incredibly flimsy and hasn't been tested, it keeps you on your toes. We move onto a small drop. Wee. We then rise up and head into an Italian Helix of Death. And considering how you're worried that this coaster might just completely collapse, it may literally be a helix of death (we'll be fine). We rise up a little hill before going through another turnaround. And hey, we have headchoppers. Please let the...they will. We then head down a small drop and gain a little speed. Crap!! We rise up and head into another turnaround into the brake run. It works! We survived! Hooray!! Now tell me. Was that worth the â‚¬200? =)
