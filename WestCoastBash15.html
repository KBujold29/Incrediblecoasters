All right. Time for West Coast Bash. Yeah, it's been too long since I last went to this event. I know I used to go to the Six Flags Magic Mountain day for years, then took a year off, before doing <a href="WestCoastBash13.html">the Knotts Day</a>. Then I took another year off, and BAM!!! Here I am for another fun West Coast Bash.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider36.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. First things first, we got ourselves a backstage tour of Ghostrider. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider37.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I only wish that we could have this tour when the ride was running. Cause if I got trains in these shots, Oh man!!! *drool*
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider38.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love this, but I don't need much time here. I've snapped all my photos. Moving on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. For our other backstage tour, we've now moved onto Sierra Sidewinder for even more fun of that kind.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nerdiness awaits inside.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wheel3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Just what I need. Another coaster wheel to clutter up my room and take up space. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign424.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Who was it again who built Sierra Sidewinder again?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="seatbelt2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey. Are you worried that your friend is going to kill you and drive you off a cliff? Have no fear. Just take a seatbelt. They'll automatically make you safer."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sierrasidewinder25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Extreme roller coaster nerds are cumming right now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="silverbullet51.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Enough with the roller coaster nerdiness and backstage tours!! Let's actually ride some god damn roller coasters!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="silverbullet52.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey! This coaster just keeps getting better. This funky overbank is just a lot of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="silverbullet53.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be Batman, but there's still some whip to this corkscrew.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevenge30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. You can tell that Morning ERT is going really well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator69.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hell yeah! It's time for Xcelerator! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Without a doubt, the best coaster at Knotts Berry Farm and one of the best coasters in California. This ride kicks ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="riptide13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Crap! Is that Riptide testing!? I just thought that it was permanently SBNO like Flashback and on it's way to being removed!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="voyagetotheironreef6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. They even have Voyage to the Iron Reef open for ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="voyagetotheironreef7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. I had a car to myself. I decided to play double-handed. Surprisingly, I wasn't nearly as bad at this as I thought I was.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ponyexpress21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* "We have people here who've never been to Knotts Berry Farm before? QUICK!!! WE MUST TAKE THEM ON PONY EXPRESS!!! BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW, PONY EXPRESS IS THE BEST RIDE EVER!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="adventurecity3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. A lot of people who flew in needed the credits at Adventure City and wanted to do some credit whoring. Now, I may have been to this park <a href="IncrediblecoastersNewYearsKBF.html">before</a> and got the credits. But since I whored out the place, they removed Treetop Racers and just this year, replaced it with a new family coaster, Rewind Racers. And since I am in fact, a credit whore, I decided to return so I could get that credit. So here I am. Never thought I'd be returning back to this park.

<p>
<center>
<img src="freewaycoaster6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may have this credit, but everyone else doesn't. So, here I go again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="freewaycoaster7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HEY KID!!! NO TEXTING ON THE RIDE!!! PUT THE DAMN PHONE DOWN!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="freewaycoaster8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may be a kiddy coaster, but at least it's a fun kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!! It's credit time!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
DAMMIT!!! What the hell am I supposed to do for the next hour!!?

<center>
Oh boy!! It's 12:00. Rewind Racers has officially opened!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But I wasn't just obtaining a credit today. No, this was a very special occasion for me. For you see...
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="phone.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I hit #500 today!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=barWV7RWkq0">Yep. Rewinder Racers ended up being Credit #500 for me.</a> Who knew I'd hit it at a place like Adventure City. =)

<p>

</center>
<center>
Enough talking. It's time to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time to head up the lifthill and get a nice view of the streets of Anaheim.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I must say, these Jr. Boomerangs really are fun rides. I'm glad that Adventure City built one to replace Treetop Racers, and wish that more would spread across America.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rewindracers9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
GO!! GO!!! GO!!! START YOUR ENGINES!!!
</center>

<p>

<img src="rewindracers10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though seriously. Read my <a href="RewindRacersPhotos.html">Rewind Racers Review</a> for more of my thoughts on this really fun family coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign426.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we had our fun at Adventure City. Time to head on back to Knotts Berry Farm.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign427.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!! Lunch time!!

It's not going to happen. =(

<center>
Hey! I didn't know that Caesar put on shows at Knotts! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wipeout11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, it's been a while since I last rode Wipeout. And it's a really fun ride. I should ride it more often.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="presentation15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

*Sigh* "Does anyone here have a question that isn't just some pathetic loser roller coaster nerdy bullsh*t?"

</center>
<center>
In other news, the Screamin Swing has now been removed. I may like these kinds of rides, but considering that it was an upcharge, I never rode it, and I didn't see a lot of other people riding either. So I'm not sad about this at all.

</center>

<p>

<img src="voodoomaze.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just like in 2013, they gave us a backstage tour of one of their Knotts Scary Farm mazes. And it does look pretty damn cool. 
</center>

<p>

Damn. I haven't ridden this ride in...I think it's been 8 years. And amazingly enough, it was actually spinning really well.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xceleratorline4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
