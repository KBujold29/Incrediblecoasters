All right. It's time for another big trip. And....we're heading back to Hawaii. So the reason we're back so soon is....my brother-in-law's family goes to Hawaii A LOT, and since my family and his family have really taken a shine to one another, they invited us. So...we're back here in Hawaii. And a quick little note. Hawaii has far stricter <a href="https://www.gohawaii.com/travel-requirements">COVID rules</a> requiring you to show proof of vaccination (That's what the wristband is for) to visit the state (Pretty sure the rule is no longer in place as of posting the update)

I know it's barely been a month since our last <a href="EastCoast21LakeCompounce.html">big trip</a>, but because nearly every single day between now and then was nothing but work, stress, and sh*t, this vacation was BADLY needed and overdue.

Thanks American Airlines for having WiFi everywhere EXCEPT ON YOUR HAWAII ROUTES!!! DAMN YOU PACIFIC OCEAN (Oh, but you can so convinently do the Atlantic Ocean for those flights to London)!!!

OK. This is REALLY concerning. The entire island of Maui appears F*CKING BROWN!!! Sure, right by the coast and the touristy sections look nice, but the rest of the island just looks DAMN NEAR DEAD!!! I know part of this is just nature, but....climate change is definately making this <a href="https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/6495536/the-islands-are-turning-brown/">worse</a>. I mean for crying out loud! This is making drought-filled Southern California look green in comparison!

Well, that was a short day in Hawaii. But hey. There's plenty more fun to be had. =)

<p>
<center>
<img src="villas13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're not only back in Hawaii on the same island, but we're even at the exact same resort that we stayed at back in <a href="Hawaii2018.html">2018</a>. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="villas14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

It may be a little repetitive, but it's still really nice and I had a really good time. So I'm still glad to be here.

It wouldn't be an island vacation without a little bit of Tiki Head action! =)

<p>
<center>
<img src="whalersvillage3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
If you remember from last time, a lot of time is spent in Whalers Village due to its close proximity to the resort and being the go-to spot if you need to buy anything.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="statue120.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
They had to get the name Whaler's Village from somewhere. ;) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="skeleton2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
Sadly, not all of the whales wind up surviving Whaler's Village.

<center>
So if you recall my original <a href="Hawaii.html">Hawaii Update</a> from when I was a cringy teenager and the site was still in its infancy, there was a candy called Half-Ass Donkey Balls that stupid 14 year-old me thought it was funny because "Ha Ha! Swearing!", Well, now as an adult, I'm checking out its sibling, Blue Balls, because 29 year old me thinks "Ha Ha! Blue Balls! Sex joke!". 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="blueballs2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Immature sex-joke aside, the candy is all right. It's basically a chocolate-covered Macadamia Nut, only dyed blue for the whole "Blue Balls" joke. I probably should've gotten the Sea-Salt ones as I would've probably enjoyed that more. But I just couldn't turn down the immature sex joke. 
</center>

This may look like an ordinary rock, but it actually shows that you're on the Ka'anapali Historical Trail, which considering is a big part of <a href="https://www.hawaiimagazine.com/watch-traditional-cliff-diving-at-kaanapali-beachs-puu-kekaa-black-rock/">cliff jumping history</a>, it's fascinating to learn about.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="villas15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, that is not one of the many pools they have. Do not swim in there.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="hammock2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

Sorry Jason. We couldn't afford to get a room out here. So we're just gonna have to sleep in the hammock for the week.
</center>
	
<p>

<center>
OK. So as you may know, this trip, along with nearly everything that happened in 2021 was originally meant for 2020. But you know, COVID-19 pushed EVERYTHING back. But for a brief moment in 2020, before COVID ruined the whole world, there was a big thing of drama about this trip since....I only have such a limited amount of time off from work, and this was conflicting with the East Coast Trip going on as....I wouldn't be able to take time off from both. But that whole drama died because.....COVID killed both trips. Great, now I get to do neither. Well, fast foreward to 2021. The same situation is happening, except....now there's a solution. My job is now having me work remotely from home. And....hey. I can just take my laptop with me. So yeah. This trip essentially turned into a <a href="https://www.themuse.com/advice/wtf-is-a-workcation-hint-something-you-need-now">workcation</a> since...I've been here before. So this was gonna be a laid back trip anyways, and I could use my actual time off for the East Coast Trip. Hawaii being 3 hours beind (2 in the winter) meant I was off relatively early and still had all afternoon to go explore, check out the beaches, eat out, and just have fun. And honestly, I expect to take many more workcations in the future because this worked out great (To far more relaxing laid back places like here. A roller-coaster workcation, simply won't work). Thank you COVID for making remote work the new norm (Don't you f*cking DARE go back to the old way!) =)

Hi there. Mr. Smily Face just here to remind you to put on sunscreen. Don't neglect on this or you'll pay dearly. Don't be a poor sucker like Kevin who learned the <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/what-the-heck-is-hells-itch/">hard way</a>. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="beach12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. We've been in Hawaii for how long without going in the ocean!? Workcation or not, that is unacceptable!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="ocean7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So sadly, I have no snorkeling pictures due to me neglecting to bring my GoPro due to....living situation at the time and the whole chaos of the time between the East Coast Trip and Hawaii that I'm honestly amazed I made it here in one peice and didn't fall apart and go insane. But I really regret it as I would've gotten some great shots, including a sea turtle close up. But you can check out some of the cool snorkeling shots from my 2018 Update.

<img src="drumsofthepacificluau2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So we technically weren't supposed to see this as it's for the hotel guests next door. But we snuck in and saw the Luau cause....hey! It's Hawaii!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="drumsofthepacificluau3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

We may not have seen the whole show since....we didn't have seats. We were just watching from the distance. But it was still really cool to see 10 minutes of the show and see some Hawaiian culture.

Though it may feel like cynical marketing (Hey kids! Buy our sunscreen! Crush from Finding Nemo says so!), it actually is true that your sunscreen can really f*ck up the ocean.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="receipt4.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We booked a Jet-Skiing experience later. Probably shouldn't thanks to my finances, but f*ck it!

This is fun and all, but can you add a Master Blaster or a Toilet Bowl (preferably a body bowl like Bazooka Bowls)? That would REALLY be appreciated.

And of course, it wouldn't be a Hawaii Trip without some cliff jumping. Yeah, Black Rock is pretty small at only 25 ft, and I miss the extreme stuff (I wanna jump the 70 ftr again), but I still had a lot of fun jumping it.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="grimreapermeme.jpg" width="632" height="394" />
</center>
<center>
And considering how nearly all the good cliff jumping spots in California are dying thanks to climate change, this is our only chance to cliff jump this year, which is really f*cking depressing. DO SOMETHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE!!! AND NOT JUST FOR CLIFF JUMPING REASONS!!! WE'RE ALL F*CKED IF THE CORRUPT IDIOTS DON'T F*CKING DO SOMETHING!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="blackrock6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, they have a show up at Black Rock since Black Rock actually is very historically important to Hawaiian culture, which is really cool.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="hotelwaterslide4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know the slide itself is nothing special, but having the slide basically be the same material as the bottom of the pool is really cool. I so would've gone down, except I didn't want to get yelled at for going down the slide of a hotel complex I'm not staying at.

<p>
<center>
<img src="jetski3.jpg" width="640" height="638" />
</center>
<center>
Going 70 mph on the ocean is just SO DAMN FUN!!! And going that fast over waves provides some NICE EJECTOR AIR MOMENTS!!! This is so fun that I'd want to Jet-Ski all the way home! Obviously, I can't do so. There's not enough gas, food, and I'd get lost and probably crashland somewhere in Antarctica (assuming I didn't crash into the Big Island) if I don't die first. But I genuinely would've jet-skiied over to Lanai (another Hawaiian island that's always visible from Lahina. You've seen it in some photos here) if it wasn't for the fact that I'd get in serious trouble and owe a sh*tload of money that I don't have.

This was great as I could go crazy at 70 mph with insane ejector air, and Jason could go fast enough to have fun without going crazy. A perfect activity. Four thumbs up.

The violets may not be as iconic to Hawaii, but they are still very nice.

So we decided to climb out onto the Jetty. Well....Jason decided to and I followed him out. Why? Uh....adventure!

Eh...this feels like a dumb idea. But....anything to help Jason be more adventerous. And even if we fell into the ocean, it's warm and not that far out, so we could swim back to shore. I'd just be out an Iphone.

And of course, it's not a trip to Hawaii without a pineapple involved.

So everyone else has left, but we have an evening flight. So we have a little bit of a bonus morning in Hawaii. So now, we're checking out the area outside the resort because hey. It's also really nice.

All right. Time to head back to the airport and to sh*tty reality. Boo! >=( (Though is it me or does the island look greener? Very happy to see that)

And that was our 3rd Hawaii Trip. Despite me spending 1/3 of the time at work, I still had a blast, got to experience a ton of fun stuff, and just relaxed and was able to unwind, and explore a place in great detail. Hope to go back to Hawaii, and hopefully a new island next time. But regardless, this was a super fun week.
