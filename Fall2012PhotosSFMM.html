All right. Its time for our yearly Fall "Instert Year Here" Photos Update, and sadly, this one only takes us to Six Flags Magic Mountain. I never had time to do anything else like Disneyland or Knotts since I've been so busy with a Mt. Everest sized pile of bullsh*t for some of the worst classes I have ever taken in my life. Hell, most of this update just comes from breif little stops at the park before I work. But hey. I had a blast doing this and working and I'm hoping to do it again next year. And before one of our work days, we finally managed to stop at the Honey Tasting Room in Piru. Something we planned on doing back in 2010 and just postponing it for "Next Time", "Next Time", "Next Time", until we finally f*cking did it 2 years later.

One of the new mazes at Fright Fest this year was Blackout, which Cody actually worked in this year.

Aftermath was a cool maze. I liked the fire, but I felt it could've been better.

I must say, Willoughby's Mansion was great. By far my favorite Fright Fest maze this year. It almost seemed like a walk through version of the Haunted Mansion.

On our final day of Fright Fest, we all decided to go to In'N'Out afterwards, with everyone in their Fright Fest Make Up (Well except me, cause I was the only one who wasn't working for Fright Fest). It was a great Fright Fest season and I'm really hoping to become a scare actor for next year.
