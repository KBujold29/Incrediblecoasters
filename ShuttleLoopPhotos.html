We're here at Nagashima Spaland to review Shuttle Loop. The parks Shuttle Loop (This park is so creative with their names). Once you get in the seat, you pull down the lap bar, buckle the seat and wait. Once all the rows are clear, you'll hear them say "Clear Dispatch" in Japanese (I assume that's what they're saying. I could easily be wrong and making an ass out of my self). Then they count down. After you hit "Ichi" (One), you launch from 0-55 mph in...I don't know how many seconds (I don't care about rollercoaster facts). The launch is decent. It's no Dododonpa, but hey, not only is this ride 40 years old, but it's also a better launch than many other coasters I've ridden. After a decent launch, you pull up into the loop. At this point, you are so grateful to have those lap bars. After flipping upside down, we pull out of the loop. Then you race for the sky as you climb up to the top of the spike. If you turn around for a second, you get a nice view of Nagashima Spaland. Then you fall backwards and rip back into the loop. Oh, and you get some pretty cool laterals in the loop. Ok, its not extreme, but its fun and a little unexpected. Then it's all straight track, Backwards Straight Track. At least here it's fun to yell at the people in line, but it doesn't matter since....you're in Japan. They speak Japanese. Then you start climbing backward, up and up you go, this time you can see how high you are. Although it's not as high as the first spike, it's still fun. Then you fall back down and glide into the brakes. After an immediete stop, you climb out and get back in line or go ride Steel Dragon (or more likely, Hakugei). Even though it's only 30 seconds long, it's still a damn good 30 seconds (Like <a href="TopThrillDragsterPhotos.html">Top Thrill Dragster</a> damn good 17 seconds). And considering how this is an incredibly rare ride, being the only one of its kind in Japan and one of six in the world. So yeah. RIDE THIS RIDE!!!
