Another day, another park in Japan. Hmm. I wonder where we're gonna be going today (OK. This photo really should've been retaken),
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign681.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After a long trip on the local Keihintohoku Line, we have another special line to head on.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="vendingmachine17.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Today's soda from Japanese Vending Machines is Pop! (God damn Midwesterners making it difficult to google this soda! It's called Soda! Get it right!) Not the first time I saw this as it is avaliable in Rocket Fizz, but hey. It's a good soda.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefall2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know why we're stopping over here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaparadise.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. Today's park is Sea Paradise. Home of one attraction that captivated me for over a decade.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bridge18.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Crossing the bridge over to Sea Paradise! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefall.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So excited to finally be riding this.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign683.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I wasn't sure if it was going to work out today thanks to all the rain and bad weather today, but hey. We are able to make it to Sea Paradise and have fun.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefall3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nothing. I'm hopping on right now bitch! =P 
	</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture151.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wait what? Blue Fall has a UFO theme!? I thought it was just a big drop tower painted blue because it's the colors of the sky and the ocean! This is confusing me!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="poncho2.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hey! It's been sprinkling this morning (Thank god the park is still open and not closed thanks to bad weather), so here! Have a poncho while riding Blue Fall! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefall4.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
OK. I'm sure you know about Blue Fall's "secret" (I'm normally very serious about stopping ride spoilers, but this is so public that I'm not gonna bother) fake drop, where it drops 10 ft and stops. It's fun and all. I liked that. But what I didn't expect was just how abrupt the fake drop stop was! HOLY CRAP!!! You just decelerate so abruptly that it's jarring. It's so sudden that it practicaly feels like a cliff jumping landing! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="carnivalhouse.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No! There are no funhouse mirrors in there. You're still just feeling the effects of Blue Fall.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign682.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know all the dolphins fled the Earth after trying to warn us, but you can still come see them. Just hop in my UFO.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaparadise2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Something to note about Sea Paradise. This is a very big park, but without a ton of rides (I know it's mainly an aquarium first, but this park could definetly use another good attraction). So yeah. Expect to be walking a lot. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bus3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Blah. They have a bus for you lazy assholes. So don't worry.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture152.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I kind of wish I spoke Japanese so I could understand what the hell this is.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. The park isn't just Blue Fall. They also have a roller coaster here worth checking out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Interesting coaster cars. But hey. I know this ride used to have OTSRs, so I'm happy to be riding with lap bars.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Surf Coaster is....an intersting ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
FAKE HELIX OF DEATH (Surf Coaster has a lot of those)!!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="seaparadise3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just looking around at the surrounding area from the observation tour.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="ocean5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I miss Japan. But hey, Sea Paradise is only a 10 minute Uber ride and 80 days of sailing away. =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluefall5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ah. That's a much better view. =) 
	</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. Surf Coaster got it's name because it's literally built right over the ocean. Which is pretty cool. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="icehouse.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wanna take a break from the ocean and sea creatures? Come check out the arctic in our upcharge ice house!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="drunkenbarrel.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry folks. The Drunken Barrels are closed.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="vikingSEAPARADISE.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may be just an ordinary pirate ship, but hey! One of the few rides here aside from Blue Fall & Surf Coaster!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Might as well get another ride on Surf Coaster as well.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WEE!!! AIRTIME!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfcoaster8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Surf Coaster is a fun coaster and all, but I will admit that it does have some...awkward transitions that I imagine would've had some headbanging with OTSRs. I know people claim it didn't back when it did, but it doesn't matter now.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture153.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh. I see that Sea Paradise has crabs.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign684.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No problem Sea Paradise. Your a fun little park to spend a couple hours in. Hope to check out the animals next time.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture154.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Really like the artwork at the Hakkeijima train station that showcases that this stop is primarily for Sea Paradise.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture155.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So apparently these are drawings done by the local children to represent all the animals at Sea Paradise (despite the fact that they're all drawing land animals and Sea Paradise is about sea creatures). Nice little cute touch.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="toilet6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Japan has not only the super fancy high tech toilets only in Japan, but it also has the opposite extreme, and have the old school squat toilets found around the 3rd world. I'm assuming they're primarily around the rural areas of Japan, but it's still quite a contrast.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="train14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hop on the train and let's head to our next destination.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm41.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap! Did the rain start up again!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="harbor.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
God damn it! I was worried about missing Sea Paradise thanks to rain earlier in the morning, but it let up and was able to do that park! But now thanks to the rain...
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yokohama Cosmoworld. The plan was to do Sea Paradise and then hit Yokohama Cosmoworld afterwards. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
However, thanks to this rain, all the major rides in the park are closed. Lame. =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="mall6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Should we hit up the mall? Nah, I've got better sh*t to do in Japan. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry Vanish. You look fun, but it looks like I will not be riding you today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
DAMN YOU RAIN!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="building10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hello really fancy hotel with a great view. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign685.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, Yokohama Cosmoworld was a bust. What else can we do in Yokohama?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture156.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yo America! How many Snoopy stores do you have in your malls!? Oh right. 0, Japan 1. America 0.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="playground5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. That's an intersting playgr...SH*T!!! THAT'S MODERN ART!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="kaitensushi.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. I've been in Japan for how long and haven't tried local sushi yet!? Yeah, it's time for that to change.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="kaitensushi2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. I'm pretty sure this'll be a controversial opinion, but I actually prefered the Sushi back home in America to the real stuff here. Now, I'm not a big seafood person. The majority of seafood, I don't like, with only a few exceptions. So sushi wasn't something I was dying to try. However, I found really good Sushi in Santa Monica which converted me (Those Baked Salmon Rolls are so good!). So I figured that the Sushi in Japan must be even better, because....this is where it came from. However, this was good sushi and all. But I still prefer Sushi Stop in Santa Monica. I mean, the crab roll is good because crab is one of the few seafoods that I like for some reason. The avacado roll however, is fine. Except for the fact that they covered it in Roe, which are fish eggs. So basically, it's caviar without the obnoxious wealth flaunting and ripping you off. And yeah. I don't like Roe. It doesn't really taste like anything, but it has one of the worst textures out of any food. Seriously, it felt like I was eating slimy sticky sand. It tasted like nothing and had the texture of hard little pebbles covered in slime that crunched and popped, and....BLUGH!!! I just couldn't get over the texture! At least it's not an obnoxious way of flashing wealth like caviar (which also tastes like slimy sand) and is just another food I strongly dislike. Should've ordered another thing from the menu.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Apparently the Yokohama Museum of Art is pretty famous and supposed to be really good. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It's time for us to stop being such uncultured swine and check out some fine art.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know most museums have a no photography rule, but there was no such rule here. So yeah. Enjoy this mini-tour of an art museum.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I've been sailing for months now, but I've finally reached Japan". 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's some traditional Japanese art for you to enjoy.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Art museum isn't just limited to paintings. They also show off these vases because hey. They're art too! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure what this painting is about or supposed to represent, but I like it.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look. Someone created a bunch of scribbles and is calling it art.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And here's a bunch of paint sloppily thrown on a canvas (It's sticking out and I have the urge to just peel it off). I guess even in Japan, you can't escape modern "art". 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why is there a giant statue of a raven in the art museum? I dunno. But hey, it works out well. Edgar Allen Poe would be pleased.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh! They have a Picasso painting here!   
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry. The art museum just isn't making a profit anymore. So we had to start putting in advertisements amongst all the famous paintings. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum13.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The advertisements are so bad they're making the artwork cry (Though seriously, it's cool to see art that I was familiar with in this museum), ;)   
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's a random ring in the middle of the museum. Why is it there? Shut up and stop questioning art! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum15.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! This is exactly what I did back when I was a child, a Christian, and bored. Who knew I could pass my goofing off as a child as art? 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum16.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is it just me or does this random kid look like Japanese Christopher Robin?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum17.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I forget who did this painting, but it's really good.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum18.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Are those flowers, fireflies, or what? What are those yellow dots!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum19.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
More authentic Japanese art.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamaartmuseum20.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, I had a really good time here. I'm happy I randomly decided to stop on by and check out some cool art. Defienetly recommend if in Yokohama.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue65.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
God Damn It! It's still raining! BTW, that statue is really cool.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We spent a couple hours at the art museum, and the rain still hasn't stopped. =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yokohamacosmoworld5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it's a bummer that I won't get to do Yokohama Cosmoworld at night, I will be back for this park. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyo14.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Back in Tokyo to explore for the night.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="gyro2.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Finally decided to stop by a local gyro stand I kept walking by for the past week (Hi Cliff), and hey. It's really good.
