Today at Canada's Wonderland, we'll be reviewing Ghoster Coaster. This is the park's kiddy woodie (When I last rode it, was called Scooby's Gasping Ghoster Coaster though). After clenching and squishing into the seats, we're off. We roll around a turn and head straight for the tiny little lifthill. While going up the lifthill, you don't think much other than "Wow. I am a credit whore". You then reach the top and head down the first drop. The first drop is actually fun and to our suprise, we go up the small hill, we actually get a little airtime. While it's very weak and over quickly, keep in mind that this is a kiddy coaster. After rolling around the turn, we dip back down and get a little more airtime. At this point, you say to yourself, this ride isn't half bad. We then dip down again before rising up into another turnaround. There's not much airtime here, but hey. This is still really fun. Especially for a kiddy coaster. We then dip back down, go through a small little bunny hop, before rising up yet again and turning under the structure. It almost feels like a decent sized woodie. You then dip back down and rise up into the brake run. It's a really fun kiddy coaster. And I would recommend that you ride this if you want to ride a kiddy coaster at Canada's Wonderland. And not only that, but it's not even the worst wooden coaster in the park.
