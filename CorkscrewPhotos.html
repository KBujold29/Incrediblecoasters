We're here at Cedar Point. Today's ride we'll be reviewing for you is Corkscrew. Once you get in the cars and pull down the OTSRs, you're off.  You roll down a dip and around a small turn. You then climb the lifthill. From the lifthill, you get a lovely view of Cedar Point, particuarly the Midway, though you can see Lake Erie. Then after climbing the lifthill, you begin to drop. Yep, we're going down the first drop. It's not amazing or anything. But we're having fun. We then head up a small hill, not expecting much, when WHOA!!! There's a pop of airtime here! It's nothing special. But hey! There's airtime right here! That's a pleasent surprise. Up next, the vertical loop. Its a fun little vertical loop that provides us with some decent positive Gs. We then rise up a small hill and goes through some straight track into a downward turn. On just like the other Arrow Corkscrew loopers, this transition gives you a good smack. God damn it. And now, we have what makes this ride called Corkscrew. 2 corkscrews going right over the midway. They're relatively fun corkscrews. We then go through another tight turn before going through another awkward turn, that yeah, gives some heading head straight into the brake run. Corkscrew is not an amazing coaster or anything. But for what it is, its a relatively fun ride that definetly exceeded my expectations and is better than similar Arrow Loopscrews. If its got a short line, a spin on it wouldn't hurt (at least not that much).
