Eventually, Canada kicked us out and forced us to flee to Michigan. And while we're in Michigan, why not go to the theme park.
</center>

First things first. Let's get the star attraction out of the way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shiveringtimbers2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was just how I thought it would be. VERY Overrated.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shiveringtimbers3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Despite it's Overratedness, it's still a fun ride.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Now that we got the star attraction out of the way, we can begin the credit whoring! Let's start with the other less talked about woodie in the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wolverinewildcat2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While Shivering Timbers was better, at least it wasn't ridicously overrated.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="wolverinewildcat3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a pretty good woodie. (Although I rode Wild Beast two days before, so my judgement might have been weak.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewMI2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next on the credit whoring agenda was the Corkscrew.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewMI.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride was just terrible!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="corkscrewMI3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Vekoma Corkscrew @ La Ronde is WAY better!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkMI.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next was the SLC.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkMI2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Somehow, I feel like I've ridden this before.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thunderhawkMI3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
Oh Yeah! Now I remember! I rode you at <a href="ThrillCoastersGeaugaLake.html">Geauga Lake</a> last year. 
</center>

In Michigans Adventure, they grill your own food in front of you. Tastes better than the typical amusement park crap.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zachszoomer.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They also have a kiddy woodie here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zachszoomer2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I think I enjoyed this kiddy woodie more because I didn't have to listen Spencer argue with a local 10 year old girl. 
</center>

</center>
<center>
Well, since we're here to credit whore, we might as well get ALL of the credits.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
The final credit needed was the Mad Mouse. The Turns sucked, but the drops were suprisingly great.
</center>

</center>

<center>
Since we conquered Michigans Adventure, we just rode Shivering Timbers as it was the best ride there. (Aside from the Chairswings of death that I forgot to photograph.)
</center>

Michigans Adventure is not a Cody Friendly Place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shiveringtimbers5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

"GOING DOWN!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shiveringtimbers6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aside from the crowds and Corkscrew, Michigans Adventure was a nice place for a suprise park.
</center>

<p>

<center>
And after a day at Michigans Adventure, there's no better place to finish it off than a meal at Hobos Tavern.
