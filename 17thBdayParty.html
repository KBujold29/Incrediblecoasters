<center>
Ok, so today was my 17th Bday Party. We went to Six Flags Magic Mtn. Nuff said.
</center>

</center>
<center>
  Unlike <a href="16thBdayParty.html">last year</a>, I wasn't a retard and remembered my season pass. And it appers Cody forgot about forgetting his season pass in <a href="First2009Update.html">January.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
   <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/X2close.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  To the dissapoment of all, X2 was closed this morning.
</center>

<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/tatsu46.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  So we decided to go run off and ride Tatsu.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/tatsu47.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Tatsu was running great today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/dejavu26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Up next, DejaVu.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/dejavu27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Well, I was going to write some caption about Dejavu's loop, but since Terminator's going to open next week, I feel that we need to pay attention to it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/terminator13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  And so we will.
</center><p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/terminator14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Terminator Salvation the Ride is proudly sponsered by Tyvek. Because Tyvek is awsome.

</center>
<center>
  Goodbye Terminator. I'll see how you are next week.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/jetstream6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
 You know we're not going to get wet at all from this whatsoever?
 </center>

  <p>
  <center>
    <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/riddlersrevenge72.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
  </center>
<center>
  Just to show you how crowded it was in the morning, this was what we waited for Riddlers.
</center>

<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/freaky.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Yes, I'm freaky. What do I win?
</center>

  Remember Boys and Girls, Breathing is good for you.

<center>
  We're in the Mooseburger Lodge, where we will eat food.
</center>

</center>
  <center>
  We learned a very valuable lesson today. Soaking bastards on Log Jammer is not fun when it's over 80 degrees. We now know that this is a winter activity.

  Can you get me a barf bag? I need one now.

  F**k the proper way to sit in Scream! This is how I'm riding from now on.

  I'd like to know more about the history of the Hamburger Spaceship ride please.

<center>
  I don't like that sign. It reminds me of La Ronde. (To see our La Ronde video, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rc1cO8Tviyw&feature=channel_page">click here.</a>)

</center>
  <center>
  Spin Out. You have made me feel nautious all my life and I have always hated you for it. You don't deserve to rest in peace you sick bastard of a ride.

  Dude! X2 is Testing!!!!!!

  &quot;Are you Type A or Type X?&quot;

<center>
  Nothing helps the line move faster than a good healthy dose of terrible pain in the arms from slapping each other's hands in a bizzare ritual known as Rock, Paper, Scissors.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/X56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  While X2 did open while we were in line, it ended up breaking down again while we at the stairs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/Xline4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  We tried all sorts of things to entertain ourselves. Jokes, Puppet Shows, Watching X2 testing, counting how many peices of gum are on X2's gum support, waking up Isaac with an annoying cell phone ring, but nothing seemed to work. We were bored sh*tless.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/sleepy4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
"
Wake up Isaac, X2 opened up for us. Now get up before Cody has to get out his cell phone again!&quot;
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/X57.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  It turns out that right after we got off X2, IT BROKE DOWN!!!!! FOR THE THIRD FU*KING TIME WITHIN A TWO HOUR PERIOD!!!!! I actually feel sorry for those right behind us. I'd be enraged if I was one of them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/sign70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  So just because I watched Isaac and Cody play the game, I only get 3 Flags?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/game3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  &quot;That's right Kevin. You chose to not play, therefor, you only get 3 out of 6 Flags. 3/6 is 50%. 50% is considered an F, therefor, you fail at life.&quot;
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/game4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  Go Isaac Go!!!! Win that Giant Stuffed Pink Gorilla!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/prize.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
  We may not have won the Giant Stuffed Pink Gorilla, but we did win these awsome prizes.
</center>

</center>
<center>
  Too many X2 breakdowns makes Isaac go &quot;BLAH!!!!!&quot; and get sick.
</center>

  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/collosus34.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
  <center>
    While Collosus is nowhere near as fun as X2, at least it doesn't break down 3 times in 2 hours.
  </center>
  
  <p>
<center>
  <img src="../../Library/Application Support/Adobe/Dreamweaver CS4/en_US/Configuration/ServerConnections/Incrediblecoasters/scream48.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

  <center>
    Ok, we need something
  with inversions for Isaac.
