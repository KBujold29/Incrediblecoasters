Alisa thought Knotts was too crowded so we left to play Mini Golf at Boomers. They also had some rides including this powered coaster! Its so pathetic that even the Ventura County Fair one beats the crap out of it! Its Not a credit Andrew. This was definetly for credit whores only! I made my smallest update ever! Yay! I really need to stop talking about random stuff so much.
