Good News. DejaVu's Single Riders line was open, and it didn't murder my new cell phone! So it's not a cell phone murdering single rider hating bitch, which means everything is back to normal! (Or is it?)

</center>
<center>
Yep. That's right. Revolution got new trains. They look really nice. And while they do make the ride look better, the ride still sucks.
