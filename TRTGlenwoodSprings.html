Sadly, the time has come. We have reached the last day of the trip. Now this wasn't a big park day (we did hit a park though). This was mostly just a day for us to explore Glenwood Springs and check out Western Colorado.
</center>

<p>

<center>
The grass is greener in Colorado. No really!! It is!!! Look at it!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lionsheadvillage.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We saw this place while driving on the freeway, and we just had to stop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lionsheadvillage2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. So thats where we ended up pulling over.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign301.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey!! I know where they're talking about and have <a href="TPRFiabilandia.html">been there before.</a> =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lionsheadvillage3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This place is a popular ski resort in the winter, and I can see why. This place is beautiful enough in the summer. I'd love to see the place draped in snow. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lionsheadvillage4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its like a little chunk of Europe that they just plopped into Colorado. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="starbucks2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, we may not have been out in the freezing snow skiing, but we can still go out for Starbucks afterwords.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time to head on over to Glenwood Springs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And this is where the entire state starts to look like Tar Creek.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Colorado is f*cking beautiful!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tunnel7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
TAKE THE TUNNEL!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I could just drive aimlessly in Colorado and still call it a good day.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, you can't get enough of these Tar Creek Colorado shots.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="coloradoriver.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh. It looks so nice and peaceful. I'm sure nothing will happen if I just pop in real quickly.
</center>

<p>

  <img src="hanginglake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
Time to hike on up to Hanging Lake. 
</center>

<center>
Dammit!!! Who left the water running!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanginglake3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we made it to Hanging Lake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanginglake4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They have a log you can walk on to get a better view. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanginglake5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its a shame that you can't go in the water here (the oil from your skin would f*ck up the Ecosystem) as this looks like a good cliff jumping spot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanginglake6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and you can also hike up to the very top of the Hanging Lake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanginglake7.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
We made it!!! We finally reached the backside of water!!!

"Hey Cody!! We don't need to book it all the way back to Ventura. We can just stay here!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="road23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On the road again. On the road again. I can't wait to get on the road again.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cablecars.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next stop, the Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cablecars2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on. Take the cable car all the way up to the theme park.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
View from the cable car ride.

I keep trying to feed the bears, but they won't open their mouths!!

<center>
Dammit! Main roller coaster closed. Oh well.
</center>

Hey, its only a Hurricane clone.

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ziplineGLENWOOD.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Please tell me this thing goes down the entire mountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinecoaster3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for the star attraction of the park. The Alpine Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinecoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was fun, but the one at Fort Fun was better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="alpinecoaster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We really need more Alpine Coasters built. These things are awesome.
</center>

Insert "Kevin is a credit whore" joke here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantcanyonswing.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. This easily takes the award for best ride location ever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantcanyonswing2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hello Glenwood Springs!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="glenwoodhotsprings.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Next up, we stopped at the Glenwood Hot Springs. Not a big fan of pools, but this place was pretty cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="glenwoodhotsprings2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
My attempts at doing flips on the diving board were called one of the most entertaining things ever.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cloud.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't look into the light!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mtgarfield.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We planned on climbing Mt. Garfield afterwords, but we couldn't find decent parking.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dirtcrack.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There's something about the dirt as these giant tiles that I really like.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="deer.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Gee. I wonder why all the deer are trying to avoid us?
</center>

</center>
<center>
And in Grand Junction, I ended up hitting some debris that ruined my splash guard (luckily, those are easy to fix). But yeah. The drive back was a real pain cause of that, and the fact that 70 freeway was cluttered with crap. I ran over several mice, a snake, had to swerve to avoid a tire, and a taxadermied owl. I much prefered the original suicide night to San Antonio. And yeah. That was the Texas/Rocky Mtn Road Trip, the first real major road trip we've done as Incrediblecoasters. It was definetly choppier and with more f*ck up moments than trips where its organized by someone else. But overall, I'd call it a great success. We hit up a ton of stuff, got on a ton of rides including all of the Rocky Mtn Coasters, hit up 7 states, really explored into Couchsurfing, can prove to everyone who doubted that I could do this that I did, and have mastered the art of the Suicide Night (they were MUCH better here, than on our first trip, Glass Beach). Plus, we did all this at a price of approximately $800. So yeah. We'll definetly be doing more road trips in the future and are totally satisfied with how the Texas/Rocky Mtn Road Trip turned out (Ok, yeah. There are definetly ways to improve for next time, but this was our first major road trip, and it was awesome).
