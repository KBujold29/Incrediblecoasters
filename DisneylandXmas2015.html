Disneyland Xmas 2015
</center>

<p>
<center>
<font size="4">
<img src="sign436.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another visit to the Disneyland Resort. Now, we pretty much primarily visit Disneyland at Christmas time nowadays, though there clearly are <a href="DisneylandSummer2015.html">exceptions</a>. So yeah, let's go and have some fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="castlecrush18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Not bad crowdwise. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="matterhorn53.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we've got some time before we can use our Fastpasses for Space Mountain, let's get on some rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="matterhorn54.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What the hell are you people doing!!? Don't you know about the abominable snowman!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign437.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meanwhile in Tomorrowland...I mean Star Wars Land, they have greatly Star-Warsified the place to cash in on Star-Wars Mania, which is clearly the hottest new craze and Disney's new cash cow. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign438.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"May the cash...I mean force be with you."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="buzzlightyear16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HEY!!! YOU'RE NOT PART OF THE STAR WARS FRANCHISE!!! GET THE F*CK OUT OF HERE BUZZ LIGHTYEAR!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="spacemtn79.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, after getting here early, our Fastpass Time has finally arrived for Space Mountain....I mean Hyperspace Mountain!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="spacemtn80.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So yeah. Hyperspace Mountain is basically just Space Mountain, except with more Galaxies, the Death Star, and other cool fighter jets from the Star Wars movies.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="spacemtn81.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So yeah. It's not nearly as dark so they can show more galaxies and fighter jets. So you do end up seeing some of the track, much like during <a href="RockinDisneyland.html">Rockin Space Mountain</a>. Except this is MUCH better than Rockin Space Mountain. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="spacemtn82.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
These are the people supposed to save the Galaxy from the First Order? We're all f*cked.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="picture92.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Random tip. If you ever get the oppertunity to go on a Disney Cruise, TAKE IT!!! <a href="DCLSpain.html">THEY ARE FREAKING AWESOME!!!</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiaadventure17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. That's enough Disneyland. Time to move onto California Adventure.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="storytellers31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Someone had the bright idea of getting reservations for Storytellers. A resteraunt we have NEVER needed reservations for. And low and behold. We didn't need them. Not a problem, just a random fun little fact. =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="metaldetectors.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. It's been discussed everywhere the last two weeks. I couldn't not respond to this. Last week, all of the Disney Parks, as well as all of the Busch/Sea World parks, have added metal detectors to all their parks in response to the recent terrorist attacks in Paris and San Bernadino. No big deal. They've been doing this at SFMM for over a decade now thanks to their gang problem from back in the 1990s and it's no big deal. Yeah, it's not THAT big of a convienence. The thing is...these things don't work. AT ALL!!! It's all just <a href="http://www.thewire.com/national/2014/01/tsa-business-security-theater-not-security/357599/">Security Theater</a> (where they add pain in the ass measures just for the illusion for the comfort of the paranoid, and way too many people are sh*tting themselves over ISIS). And honestly, yeah. That pisses me off, because you're wasting my time and not actually doing anything. I've known plenty of people who have EASILY been able to sneak knifes beyond these metal detectors. They don't do a damn thing unless the goal is to slow everyone down. I know Security Theater is primarily talked about in terms of Airport Security and the TSA, and yeah. It's all total bullsh*t. I hate the TSA and all that pointless crap, but I don't say anything, deal with it, and allow them to take naked pictures of me with the scanner (<a href="http://mic.com/articles/80811/i-saw-you-naked-and-yes-we-were-laughing-a-tsa-agent-spills-the-beans-on-his-job#.npA0pvYwG">and laugh at my naked body</a>), because I just want to be left alone, get through this stupid bullsh*t as quickly as possible, and just go to Europe and enjoy myself. And yeah, it's the same thing here. I'll bitch about it, but I won't do anything. I'm sure I'll adjust and ignore them, just like I do at SFMM, but it really frustrates me when we respond to terrorism by being terrorized and putting up more Security Theater for more illusions and pretending that we're doing something to solve the problem. I know this problem goes WAY beyond just theme parks, but I still don't like it anywhere.

<center>
Sorry. Littering assholes are going to ruin it all.
</center>

Read the caption above.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rainstorm29.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Notice anything about the weather? Yeah, it's raining. And while it didn't work miracles for us like it did <a href="DisneylandXmas2010.html">2010</a>, but at least we didn't have to deal with the HORRENDOUS Maximum Capacity Crowds of <a href="DisneylandXmas09.html">2009</a>. So that was definetly good news.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="carsland11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We may have not gotten lucky and don't have to deal with insane crowds, but yeah. It's still busy. We're NOT gonna get to do Carsland today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin130.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. You know what time it is? Yep, CA Screamin Time!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin131.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Luckily, the Screamin Line is never really that long, so we were able to get multiple rides in.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin132.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And low and behold, we wound up winning the Front Row lottery. SWEET!!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin133.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure what was up with Screamin today, but it was particuarly forceful today. Especially in the loop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin134.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HEY GUYS!!! HOWS IT GOING!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="californiascreamin135.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Check me out. I'm rockin out on CA Screamin."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="toystorymania29.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And hey. Time for another one of our favorite dark rides. Toy Story Mania.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="toystorymania30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just remember. Everything depends on this game.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="toystorymania31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not bad, but I can do better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="picture93.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Insert yourself here".
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dcatrolley4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know that trolley doesn't really go anywhere guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="animation19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Time to spend more time in Animation.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="picture94.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love all the artwork in here. Easily one of the hidden gems of the Disneyland Resort.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="animation20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Today, they were showing you how to draw Baymax. Easily my favorite Disney character, and of course, I had to draw him with Fatass Stan. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="towerofterror38.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Our Tower of Terror Fastpasses are ready.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="towerofterror39.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure what was wrong with the ride. It was still fun and all, but there was definetly something screwy with all the special effects before the dropping.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hauntedmansion35.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tis the season for Haunted Mansion Holiday.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hauntedmansion36.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Am I the only one thinking there needs to be more stuff for Nightmare Before Christmas? Seriously, let's have some more fun with all the other holidays and doors.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hauntedmansion37.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<img src="bigthundermtn63.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Surprisingly, there was no line at all for Big Thunder Mountain. Thank you Fantasmic.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bigthundermtn64.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No, don't worry about anything Big Thunder Mountain Goat. Everything will be fine. And thanks again for helping out with our Holiday Fireworks. Just stand here with the dynamite."

<img src="smallworld40.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, everyone else wants to. Merry Christmas everyone else. We're gonna ride Small World.
</center>

<img src="smallworld42.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"I just realized. Annoying, Repetitive? This must be the hottest new song!! Why isn't It's a Small World dominating the Billboard Top 100? I know they like this sort of crap!!" =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="smallworld43.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. 2015 wasn't the worst year, but I gotta be honest. It hasn't been that good a year. ESPECIALLY the last three months. Hoping for much needed improvements and less bullsh*t in 2016.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="smallworld44.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* "MUSLIMS!!? WE MUST BAN THEM FROM ENTERING OUR COUNTRY, KEEP NATIONAL DATABASES FOR ALL THE ONES CURRENTLY HERE, CARPET BOMB THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AND MAYBE WE'LL EVEN PUT THEM IN CONCENTRATION CAMPS!!!! Golly gee, I wonder why people are calling me a fascist and comparing me to Hitler?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="smallworld45.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Honestly, I kind of want to ride Small World with some of my other travelholic friends and just listen to them complain about how innacurate every country they represent is." =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="smallworld46.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* "LATINOS!!? THEIFS!!! CRIMINALS!!! RAPISTS!!! BUILD A GIANT WALL!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="smallworld47.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Poor Rudolph. I know how tough it is being bullied simply for being gay...I mean having a red nose!!!
</center>


<p>
<center>
<img src="christmastree11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
