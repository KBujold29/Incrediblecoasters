     <img src="swashbuckler2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
We are all having way too much fun on Swashbuckler! Mylo was trying to touch the ground, I'm being a filming nut, Alisa and Daniella are seeing how high Superman is going, Andrew is Screaming "I'm Winning!" and Isaac is trying to kick Andrews chair to shut him up!

   <p>

   </center>
   <center>
Superman wasn't going very high today!

Only Mylo has the appropriate looks for riding Bucaneer.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="mooseburgerlodge3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
The waiters at Mooseburgerlodge made me wear this hat while they sang Happy Birthday to me.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="mooseburgerlodge4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
   </center>
Mylo pushed my face into the mini cake!

   </center>

OMG! The teacups in Bugs Bunny World spun SO fast! Its insane! Only Isaac was smart and decided to stay off.

   <p>

     <img src="goliath.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
Goliath. A great hyper coaster!

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="goliath2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
I would really like it if Magic Mtn put in MORE than 1 Airtime hill on Goliath though.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="grindergearworks.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
We all really enjoyed Grinder Gearworks.

   <center>
     <img src="atomsmasher.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
  </center>
We had a who fight the lateral Gs contest on Atom Smasher! (And Andrew won).

Mylo trys out the plate Toss. He was good at it.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="ballthrow.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
Isaac tries the Ball Throw. He was good at it. But not as good as the Win balls game from Knotts.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="ballthrow2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>

I decided to try the Ball Throw myself. I'm pretty good at it!

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="circuswheel.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
   </center>
Circus Wheel  was also running crazy. Isaac was once again, the only one smart enough to stay off it.

   <p>
   <center>
     <img src="batmantheride.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
   </center>
We are all in the sewers ready to ride Batman the Ride.
