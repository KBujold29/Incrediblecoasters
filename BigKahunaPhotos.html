We're here at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor (Phoenix), and we're here to ride the parks family raft ride, Big Kahuna. I'm sure many people will hear this and just shrug their shoulders. It's a family raft ride. Nothing special. Just a large family water slide that everyone can enjoy. That seems to be what the average famy raft slide is about. But....unless you count <a href="MammothPhotos.html">Mammoth</a> (I personally don't and consider that to be cheating), then this is honestly my favorite of the family raft slides. Yeah. We may have just gotten really lucky and the ride is normally slower and more boring, but regardless, I had a really good ride on this slide. So let's get in the raft, and away we go. Dip down and go around a turn. Off to a mild start. Go around another turn, which is a downward helix. OK. Starting to gain a little speed. Down a tiny dip and into another helix. Whoa! It's starting to get fast! And we're even getting some laterals! Not sure if this is just because the people we rode with were....kind of fat. And also shared the same goal of getting it to go up as high as possible. Down another tiny drop before going through another couple downward helixes, slithering their way to the scorching desert ground. And not a single trim in sight. Love how this place encourages you to go high. Down another small drop, and into the pool! DAMN!!! This is a FUN ONE!!! Definately one of the better family raft sides. So yeah. If you find yourself at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor (Phoenix), then do not forget to check this ride out.
