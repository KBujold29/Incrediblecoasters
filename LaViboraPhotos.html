 We're here at Six Flags Over Texas. For today's ride, we'll be traveling back in time to review La Vibora. After we squeezed into the ride's cars, we climbed up the lift hill. Now keep in mind that these cars had absolutely no leg room. So tall guys, beware. Once you reached the top, you curved down the first drop. It wasn't much, but it still was pretty fun. After picking up some speed, we headed straight into a turn. Now on a bobsled, there are no upstop wheels or side wheels, so these cars can move around on the track. So on the turns, you swung up a little bit. It was almost like a suspended coaster. Except there are at least still some suspended coasters left in the world. =( It was pretty cool. We were rolling quite a bit. Unfortunetly, we hit a set of brakes right after that big turn, reducing our speed back to nothing. We then went down another twisty drop. This twisty drop however, was much more exciting than our first drop as we swayed more on this one. We then went through a sort of S turn where we turned right, only to then turn left. On bobsleds, this is awesome as it provides a pretty good swaying sensation. However, we then just glided into yet another brake run. And these brake runs hurt your thighs due to the lack of legroom. So that was not a good thing. Then there was another twisty drop. Unfortunetly, this one was not nearly as crazy as the other ones. We then went through another S Turn, only also not nearly as insane that leads right into, another brake run. At this point, I just want to scream "STOP IT WITH THE F*CKING MILLION MID COURSE BRAKES!!!" We then rolled down a sort of half helix before rolling through a slow turn into the final brake run. While it was an interesting ride, it really felt watered down. I mean, I'm sure without the million mid course brakes, this thing would've haul ass. While it sucks to see the ride toned down so much. There was a brief period where it was the last Intamin Bobsled left, and it was truly something special. Well, I spoke too soon as it quickly was killed and now this is an extinct model. Bummer. =(
