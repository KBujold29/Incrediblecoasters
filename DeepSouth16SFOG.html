Aww. Last park of the trip. I know it's a bummer that it's this soon since this trip was much quicker than past trips. But hey. We're finishing at one of the few Six Flags parks I hadn't visited.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sixflagsovergeorgia2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
YAY!!! We made it to Six Flags Over Georgia!!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>

"Hey you! Come hop the fence and retreive your hat. Don't worry. Nothing will happen."
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sixflagsovergeorgia3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And in more good news, Six Flags Over Georgia is one of the best parks in the chain. And considering how I only have two more Six Flags parks left to visit, that's saying something. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign479.JPG">
</center>
<center>
"Crap! We teleported back to Six Flags Magic Mountain! NO!!! I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME YET!!!"
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign475.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Where should we go first?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Oh, I know. Lets start out with Georgia Scorcher.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
OK. I really like Six Flags Over Georgia. The only problem I had with the park were the operations for Georgia Scorcher. Seriously guys. The one train operations are not cool. Especially on B&M Stand Ups, which are a pain in the ass to load. That is not acceptable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I know you might not think much of Georgia Scorcher since its dwarfed by Goliath, but this ride is freaking awesome!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher4.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Seriously, this thing is almost like a Stand Up Batman the Ride. I just love it. It's the only stand up that comes close to Riddlers Revenge (that's still my favorite, but Georgia Scorcher is a close 2nd).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher5.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
This is the ride that Iron Wolf and both Vortexes should be.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher6.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Hey! I just realized this. Now that I've ridden Georgia Scorcher, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pB0Uiq4NTs0">I can now claim to have ridden every single B&M Stand Up Coaster!</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildive.JPG">
</center>
<center>
OK. Dare Devil Dive opened up. Gotta get on it before the line grows insanely long.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildive2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey. I'm just happy that they run this ride with only lap bars.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildive3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
It's a fun ride and all, but it's far from the best Euro Fighter.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildive4.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
BEYOND 90 DEGREES!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildive5.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It looks really cool and twisty, but there's just something about it that while fun, just isn't that crazy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="daredevildiveline.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Dare Devil Dive is another one of those coasters that got the Virtual Reality treatment. And yeah. That really hurts operations. Though I did enjoy having one line for VR Riders and one for non-VR riders. Yeah, I liked the VR on New Revolution, but I also just enjoy riding the rides as they are. And I wanted to experience Dare Devil Dive as it is. So I didn't do the VR on it. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG.JPG">
</center>
<center>
OK. Enough is enough. Let's do the best ride in the park. Goliath.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. There's no doubt about it. This is easily my favorite B&M Hyper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Aww. Isn't Georgia Scorcher so cute down there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG4.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
That downward helix is really good. Much better than the upward helix on Nitro.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG5.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Love just how agressive Goliath @ SFOG is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="gothamcity.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I'm just gonna say this. The Gotham City at Six Flags Over Georgia is fantastic. Easily the best Gotham City that Six Flags has. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="crimeswing.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Just take a look at what they did with their chairswings.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jokerchaos.JPG">
</center>
<center>
"Oh no! We can't ride the Super Loop! What a shame!" =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Enough of the tour. We're here for Mindbender.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign478.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Oh, and while rides at Six Flags Over Georgia does have single rider lines, they unfortunetly are the worst kind, where you have to wait in 90% of the regular line and then you enter the single rider line. I F*CKING HATE THAT!!! There's no reason to do that!!! Well, at least Six Flags Over Georgia isn't crowded today, so we don't have to worry about that.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I can definetly say that Mindbender is freaking great. Powerful loops, ejector air, and much more.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I know Mindbender has this dive drop and helix up that some will claim to be a 3rd inversion. What!? NO!!! NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!! Now I love this dive drop. It's a ton of fun, but don't fool yourself. That's no inversion. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender4.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. You're gonna get your ass glued to your seat at this point.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantherideSFOG.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Another Six Flags Park. Another Batman the Ride clone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantherideSFOG2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
But hey. This isn't just an ordinary Batman. It's the headless Batman the Ride!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantherideSFOG3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Warning. Idiots may be crossing here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="harlyquinnspinsanity.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Hey. Might as well give the tilt a whirl a spin. It's running really good here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I don't think I've heard of this ride before.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
OH F*CK!!! IT'S NINJA!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I know nobody else in the coaster community would agree with me, but I actually liked this ride. I found it fun! You're going to see this on our <a href="Top10UnderratedCoasters.html">Top 10 Underrated Coasters List</a>.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk4.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. There were a couple spots on the ride where you could tell there used to be some bad headbanging in a couple moments on the ride. But the new vest restraints managed to fix that. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="greatamericanscreammachine.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Up next is Great American Scream Machine, another seriously underrated coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="greatamericanscreammachine2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Seriously, there's some REALLY good airtime on this ride. Especially at the end.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="greatamericanscreammachine3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Between this and Blue Hawk, I'd call this the underrated corner of the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermanultimateflightSFOG.JPG">
</center>
<center>
F*ck!! Never mind!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermanultimateflightSFOG2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I may not be a big fan of these Superman: Ultimate Flight rides, but they're fun rides. Plus, this one has a tunnel. So it's the best one of the three (not saying much).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermanultimateflightSFOG3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Yay!! I'm all done with all the Superman: Ultimate Flights!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="demolition.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Considering how these bumper cars most likely had some bullsh*t One Way Rule, I won't miss them at all.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jokerfunhousecoaster.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Might as well get the rest of the credits.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jokerfunhousecoaster2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah, it's a really good kiddy coaster. The only downside is the line. Seriously, this was the longest line we waited in all day. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dahlonegaminetrain.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Honestly, aside from the ending, this ride is just like the kiddy coaster we just rode.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="acrophobia.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Dude! We still have yet to ride Acrophobia!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign476.JPG">
</center>
<center>
See. Godzillas not that big. =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="acrophobia2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I know I rode a clone of this at <a href="TPRMovieParkGermany.html">Movie Park Germany</a> 4 years ago, and it's just as amazing here. I really wish that more drop towers pushed the "OH SH*T!!!" button like these rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiacyclone.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. This is the only coaster left for us to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiacyclone2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Honestly, I was really dissapointed with this ride. It was just super slow and sluggish.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiacyclone3.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I appreciate it not being brutal and trying to kill me, but it also wasn't that crazy bucking horse coaster I was hoping for. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="chickfila4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah, I know it's been a while since I've been to Chick Fil A. I temporarily boycotted them after the Dan Cathy homophobia controversy, but after really thinking about it, and how I still buy the products of companies that do much worse than Chick Fil A, I stopped boycotting and started going again. Though the boycott, while it didn't last, it did denormalize going for me as I used to go to Chick Fil A all the time, whereas I go very rarely now. I kind of forgot just how good it is. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="georgiascorcher7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey. Might as well take a reride on Georgia Scorcher since that ride kicks ass!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign477.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Georgia Scorcher is sponsered by lesiban sex. Best sponsership Six Flags has ever done =).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="logjamboree.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah, there's nothing special about this log flume. But it's hot outside and the line is short. F*ck it!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Anyone up for another ride on Goliath @ SFOG.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG7.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It may not be as intense as Fury 325, but do not just think this is yet another B&M Hyper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG8.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Seriously, this helix is really strong. I actually greyed out briefly on one of my rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG9.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
And on top of great speed and nice laterals, it has a lot of really good airtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG10.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Seriously, just going into the brake run provides you with some really good ejector air.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="monstermansion.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey. They have a dark ride at Six Flags Over Georgia. And not just a dark ride, a unique and original dark ride. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="monstermansion2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
So happy to see that desegregation has finally occured in the South and now humans and monsters can attend the same Monster Picnic. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="monstermansion3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
F*ck it! I'll kiss anyone. Let's do it!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="monstermansion4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Best food in all of Six Flags Over Georgia.
</center>

<p>

The Devil Went Down to Georgia.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="monstermansion6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'd love to come back for another Monster Picnic (GAH!! NOW I HAVE THAT STUPID SONG STUCK IN MY HEAD!!!).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skybuckets.JPG">
</center>

Love that they still have their skyride here. And hey, it's good for shots.

"Hey. You wanna ride a ride themed to driving, which we've been doing this entire trip and all the time in my normal daily life!? No? TOO F*CKING BAD!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'm bothering to reride Ninja...I mean Blue Hawk. I genuinely like it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bluehawk5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I'm still dumbfounded how something that looks so evil and so similar to Gouderix, the worst coaster I've ever ridden, can be a decent ride!
</center>

<p>
<center>

        Just a friendly little reminder on just how terrible a ride Gouderix is for comparison.
        </center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyscreamerSFOG.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey! Let's do the Star Flyer!! Aww. The view is just of Georgia. That's not exciting.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliathSFOG11.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Let's do some night time rides on Goliath. And hey, started to sprinkle towards the end.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I know there's not much time left, but hey. Might as well grab a couple Mindbender rides (Love how they're advertising that they're only running one train. Please do this at Georgia Scorcher as well. Or better yet, just run two trains).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbenderline.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I don't think we're gonna have a problem with one train operations here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mindbender6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. During our final couple Mindbender rides, it began to pour. HOLY CRAP!!! THOSE RIDES WERE AMAZING!!! Schwarzkoph + Rain = AWESOME!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wafflehouse2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And finally, it's not a trip to the Deep South without stopping at Waffle House.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wafflehouse3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Really wish Waffle House would spread to the West Coast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="airport.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And that was our Deep South Trip. I got to experience a new part of the country I hadn't visited and went to several new parks, all of which I really liked. There were a lot of good coasters, and Fury 325 is a favorite of mine. Yeah, it was a bummer that Lightning Rod and Rampage were closed, but hey. That just means I have to go back. I still had a blast on this trip, I have almost all of the United States done, and I've got some good plans for the future that I can hopefully put into effect.
