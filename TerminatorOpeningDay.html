  Ok. The ride was quite good. It had lots of speed, lots of fun twisty turns and even a few pops of airtime. This is quite a good addition to Six Flags Magic Mountain.

  Even though the line was 2 hours long, I managed to get on it in less than 5 minutes thanks to the Single Riders Line.

    I'm not sure how this yellow gunk got here, but I'm pretty sure Christian Bale is somehow responsible.

  These M&amp;Ms are playing the game. Therefor, they get Six Flags.

  <center>
    Despite what you may be thinking. I'm actually not the danger.
  </center>

<p>

  <img src="group.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

  This is the real danger. (No, I'm not talking about the blurry photo.) I'm talking about big groups of 20 that are all using Qbots. Ok, It's fine to use the Qbot. You payed for it and you have the right to go ahead. But when you are a group of 20 all using the Qbot, then you're just being a bunch of assholes. It's also even more annoying when they're not eveing using Qbots, but instead are using Handicapped Passes. I don't even think a single one of those twenty assholes was handicapped in any way. At least when Disney has a handicapped pass, they limit you to only using it on six people. This group was more than three times past that limit!!!! So, that's something you could learn from Disney. But the good news was that X2 at night was awsome.
