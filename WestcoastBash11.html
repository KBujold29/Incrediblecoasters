<center>
Well, the day has finally come. Westcoast Bash is finally here, and in typical Westcoast Bash fashion, it totally kicked ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sfmmentrance8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on Six Flags!!! Let us in and begin Westcoast Bash!!!! We've been waiting all year for this!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doughnuts6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just like in previous years, Westcoast Bash has kickass doughnuts for us to fuel up on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="doughnuts7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"America may have all sorts of incredibly fatty and unhealthy foods, but they have nothing on my Doughnut Sandwich!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath86.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. That's enough food for now. Let's get riding!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath87.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Goliath's stuck. Moving on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream83.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While I thought this years Morning ERT wasn't quite as good as it was in previous years. But hey, Night ERT was one of the best ever and even less than average WCB Morning ERT still kicks total ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="geese8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Are you my mother?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescapemural.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What's wrong with this picture?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X89.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now we're getting to the really good stuff.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X90.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Dude. I've got doughnuts and X2. This day is already f*cking amazing."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride67.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh. This is how ERT should be.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="greenlantern2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Green Lantern Construction Update. Still looks like a clone of Dirt the ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now that Morning ERT is over, it's time for a backstage tour of one of Six Flags Magic Mtn's Fright Fest Mazes, Bite II. (Yes, Westcoast Bash is that awesome.)
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it isn't one of my favorite Fright Fest mazes, I'm just glad to see it behind the scenes instead of seeing it in maze forms like I saw in <a href="Fall2010PhotosSFMM.html">Fright Fest.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Blugh. There's too much moss in here."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Get over it you big baby.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Antonio, is that you?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bite6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"No. We fired him. I found out that I'm much scarier than Antonio and will be in Bite II from now." 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator67.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In other news, Apocolypse finally got its permanent sign, and it's much better than the <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/terminator59.JPG">old sign.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terminator68.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Big Mike! How's it going!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for Westcoast Bash Lunch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP!!!! THAT'S THE LINE TO GET A Q-BOT!!!!? Luckily we have Westcoast Bash or we'd be screwed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="whistlestoppark.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, Thomas Town has officially made the transition to Whistlestop Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="percyrailway3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of all the names they could've came up with, they ended up going with Magic Flyer. Something about that being a name for a kiddy coaster just doesn't seem right.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape51.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nice. They already put the new Superman Logo on the signs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape52.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Today is also offically Backwards Superman's Opening Day. No wonder it's so damn crowded.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="grindersgearworks10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Take a good look at this sign because Grinders Gearworks won't be called Grinders Gearworks for long.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh. Why are we riding Tidal Wave in this type of weather?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge101.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That's more of the types of rides we should be riding.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevengeline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While it may look like we're screwed here, we're not thanks to the fact that groups like this are f*cking idiots. =) "WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE HAVE TO SPLIT UP!!!! THAT WAS NEVER PART OF THE DEAL!!!!! WE WOULD RATHER DIE THAN SPLIT UP WITH OUR PRECIOUS GROUPS!!! THEY ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN BREATHING, EATING, AND DRINKING PUT TOGETHER!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="backstagetour15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for yet another kickass Westcoast Bash Backstage Tour.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath88.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This year, we got a Goliath Backstage Tour and it was awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath89.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. This shot kicks major major major ass.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath90.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fake Helix of Death!!!!!
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath91.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. These Goliath shots are worth the WCB price alone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath92.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goliath Crotch Shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath93.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I see a long object going into a small dark hole.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath94.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goliath Backstage Tour Awesomeness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jetstream13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. Whatever. It's not like you get wet on this ride or anything.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="presentation.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for the annual WCB Q&A Session.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="presentation2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Could they possibly be foreshadowing Revolution's future here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="presentation3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Happy Birthday Kid at Westcoast Bash. Here's a tube from SFMM."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge102.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! Riddlers Revenge was hauling ass today!!! I mean, it was good. Really f*cking good. In fact, I can't remember the last time Riddlers Revenge ran this well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crowds26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. This is opening day all right.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninjaline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WHY THE F*CK HAS NINJA BEEN SO CROWDED THIS YEAR!!!? DID THE GP REALLY JUST DISCOVER THAT SUSPENDED COASTERS ARE RARE, SO NOW THEY'RE ALL RIDING NINJA?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skytower9.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Wow. It looks like they really took my advice and just literally turned Grad Nite 2010 into Grad Nite 2011.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skytowermuseum13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, where is most of the Sky Tower Museum?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skytowermuseum14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Don't worry. Tim and Neal said that they're just adjusting the Sky Tower Museum. It's here to stay."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="skytowermuseum15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. Nothing can possibly go wrong here. I've always had wonderful luck putting my camera on trash cans in the past. Oh, and I have great luck with my cameras on basketball courts as well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roaringrapids6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's cold, cloudy, and going to rain tonight. This sounds like the perfect day to go on Roaring Rapids.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="roaringrapids7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We're f*cking idiots.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coin2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. Screw the Doughnuts, ERT, Backstage Tours, and Q&A. Finding this dime was the real highlight of Westcoast Bash.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="studio6F5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. What happened to the sofas in Studio 6F?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign173.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've been seeing this ad for the Guacomole Burger for like forever. So I finally tried it, and it was actually pretty decent.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="canyonblaster16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're sad and pathetic and we know it. Moving on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath95.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn. Night ERT is started and they still have to weed out the GP from the lines. DAMN!!!! It was crowded today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wait a minute. What's going on here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. It's raining during Night ERT. This is going to make for some very fun rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream84.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ahh. That's much better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scream85.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This year, they turned Scream into Night Strobe Scream. While it wasn't really much, at least they tried doing something with it. (Plus, this isn't the only thing they did during our Night ERT. ;) )
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride68.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What's up with all the smoke rising up from Batman?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride69.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! They added fog and blue lights to Batman!!!! And it totally kicked ass and made it much better!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Batman the ride through the fog and blue lights.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="batmantheride71.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This kicked ass!!!! Please do this with Batman more often! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape53.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right!!!! We got Night Time ERT on Superman!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="supermantheescape54.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hell, they were still running it despite the drizzle!!! And that kicked ass even if it did hurt like hell going back forewards!!!! We got many Superman rides in until they had to close it due to the rain getting harder.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tatsuline4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. Tatsu in the rain is awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X91.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and for X2, they had a special WCB Soundtrack just like they did for Apocolypse last year.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="Xline9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn. X2 with WCB Soundtrack is really popular.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="X92.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
X2 with WCB Audio kicked ass and Westcoast Bash 2011 kicked ass. I'm totally looking foreword to Westcoast Bash 2012.
