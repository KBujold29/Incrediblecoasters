For today's review, we are heading to Canobie Lake Park to review Untamed. This is the parks Euro Fighter, and it's realtively new. However, it still blends in beautifully with the park, with the supports being themed as birch trees. Love that. You would never suspect it looking out of place or ruining the atmosphere of Canobie Lake Park. So let's hop aboard. We get in the cars, pull down the OTSRs and we're off!!! We roll around a turn and head straight for the vertical lift. For anyone who's never done a vertical lift before, it's pretty intimidating to just stare at. But before you know it, the lift begins to move and you begin to climb. As you're climbing, all you're able to see is the sky. So that's pretty cool. Anyways, you reach the top of the lifthill and suddenly slow down. Yep. It's got the Goliath effect. Oh well. No big deal. But right as you're getting a good view of Canobie Lake Park, you are yanked down in a beyond 90 degree drop. This provides you with some pretty good ejector airtime and instantly plants a smile on your face. After that awesome drop, you soar up into a vertical loop. And yeah, that's really fun and plants one nice smile on your face. Up next, a cutback (I know technically an overbanked turn, but dammit!! It looks like an inversion. It feels like an inversion. I'm counting this god dammit!!!). The cutback is fun and actually provides a nice little moment of hangtime. I must say, I really like this element. I wish cutbacks would make a comeback. We rise up around a curved turn that provides us with some nice laterals. This transitions quite nicely into an inline twist that actually provides us with some nice hangtime. Yeah, you don't get that too often on most coasters. So it's definetly appreciated here. It again transitions directly into a downward curve, giving us some nice laterals as well as a little more speed. We then head into an upward helix. It's nothing special, but it's still a fun helix none the less. And sadly, we head straight into the brake run from there. Yeah, it's pretty short. So that's a downside. Another downside, it's kind of on the rough side. Now, it's nothing unbearable or anything (no pun intended), but compared to other Euro Fighters, it's got some headbanging. So when you get laterals, brace yourself. But despite its flaws, Untamed is still a really fun ride and a great fit for Canobie Lake Park. I'd definetly give it a ride or two while visiting the park.
