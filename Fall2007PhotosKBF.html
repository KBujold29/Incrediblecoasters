Here is our Fall 2007 Photos Update. A large majority of the update stupidity is just being at these theme parks with a blazing wildfire nearby. But there is still more stupidity and lots of fun. Anyways, we started off at Knotts Berry Farm.

Silver Bullet was running great today. It even had some force!!!!
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
But no matter how well Silver Bullet is running, it's still the only B&M to lack any sort of whip in it's Heartline Spin.

Peanuts Playhouse. The place to go when the ash gets thick.

Curse this wretched fire into the fiery depths of hell!!!!

<center>
Now that the ash has cleared up a little, let's go on a very old rollercoaster that could fall apart.
</center>

More crappy coasters were ridden while the wildfires burned.

And yet, no one seems to care.

Supreme Scream has changed. It barley holds you up at the top.

</center>
<center>
Xcelerator. Hmmm, What does Xcelerators Top Hat have that Storm Runners doesn't?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xcelerator17.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Its a shame that Top Thrill Dragster does nothing after it unlike Xcelerator.
</center>

And nothing goes better with a crazy good ride than a nice thick coat of ash.

Lousy Cheapstakes. If I have to pay to ride a Screaming Swing, It should at least be better than the free one!!! Skyhawk Rules!!!

Here's an example of how mush ash there was. Look at the part of the pool that wasn't cleaned.
