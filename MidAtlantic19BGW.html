All right. So the trip has mosty been non-coaster days and revisits of parks I've been to. There's only been one new park so far. Well now, we get to the good stuff and one of the last major parks I hadn't visited in the US, well, I'm finally about to cross that off today. =) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="apolloschariot.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I spy a major new credit for me today.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="buschgardenswilliamsberg2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Oh no! The credit gods are frowning at me today! Well, if we had to miss one credit today, it would EASILY be Grover's Alpine Express. The kiddy coaster.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bridge21.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Come on. Let's cross the bridge over into Busch Gardens Williamsberg.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="buschgardenswilliamsberg3.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Wait. Are we still in the U.S, or are we now in Jolly old England now?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="buschgardenswilliamsberg4.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So excited to finally do Busch Gardens Williamsberg! =) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="picture202.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

<center>
Please don't eat me for lunch.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="apolloschariot2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
OK! Enough chit-chatting. Time to get riding!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="apolloschariot3.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So I was looking foreward to this ride since....it's one of the higher ranked B&M Hypers. Sad to say, NOPE!!! 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="apolloschariot4.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It's not a bad ride by any means. It's not even the worst B&M Hyper. But is is one of the weaker ones, the others have MUCH better floater air, and my least favorite of the three B&Ms here.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tempesto.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Forgot about this ride. Well, it's right by Apollo's Chariot. So let's ride.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign775.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
OK. So much like Electric Eel, Tempesto is zipper-intolerant. However, their solution is instead, to give you a fanny pack to wear with your stuff. Kind of moot as...the zipper on my pants is just as secure as your fannypack zipper. But I still prefer this as this elimates the paranoia and anxiety of...someone is gonna steal all my sh*t (I still remember Will's camera at Europa Park!). So this is much better. But on top of that....they seem to not be enforcing it at all today. So I don't even have the minor inconveniance of emptying my pockets. So that's good (don't worry. Zippered pockets).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tempesto2.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Yep. It's another one of those Premier Skyrockets that are being cloned at all the Busch/Sea World parks (how long until Sea World San Antonio gets one?)
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tempesto3.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
They're fun rides and all, but....Tempesto sort of gets ignored and overshadowed by all the other better coasters at this park.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="escapefrompompeii.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So yeah. While we're here. We have to talk about Escape from Pompeii.
</center>
	 
 <p>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="escapefrompompeii2.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
While the ride itself is just a standard shoot the chutes, the theming is really good! OK, not Disney good. But much better than most similar rides. It makes what is normally something I don't bother with into something that is a must ride when visiting Busch Gardens Williamsberg.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign776.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So one week after I visited, Busch Gardens Williamsberg announced their new for 2020 coaster, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmJppkgZlpg">Pantheon</a>.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bgwconstruction.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Pantheon is this Multi-Launched Intamin Looper, and....it looks like it will kick ass. The only thing that looks better out of the new for 2020 coasters is Iron Gwazi. This thing just looks amazing. Can't wait to ride this thing next BGW visit.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="buschgardenswilliamsberg5.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Pantheon coming soon.
</center>

Get on the tractor boy! That landscaping ain't gonna take care of itself!

 <p>
<center>
<img src="statue99.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I see something in those gardens. I'm just not sure what. =) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="statue100.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Hard to choose whether Busch Gardens Tampa or Busch Gardens Williamsberg is better. Partially since it's been <a href="ThanksgivingBGA.html">12 years</a> since my last BGT visit (I'm REALLY overdue to go back to Florida). But both are beautiful parks with a lot of great coasters that I really enjoy visiting. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="statue101.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Probably not a good idea for us to hit Oktoberfest (I'll get around to the real thing. EVENTUALLY!!!).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign777.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
We're still in the Italy section. Now it's just themed to San Marco, the center of Venice (oddly enough, the one part of Italy I have NOT visited).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="buschgardenswilliamsberg6.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
The theming in this park actually looks like Europe. And considering how much I love that part of the world, a park with that theme always makes me happy.
</center>
	 
<p>
<center>
<img src="lunch90.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
The food here, like all the Busch Gardens/Sea World parks, is pretty good (any time I can get Black Forest Cake, I'm happy).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="verbolten.png" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Enough dilly dallying and looking around at the great theming! We're IncredibleCOASTERS! Time for another coaster! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="verbolten3.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Verbolten was a coaster I never really thought much about other than....it was the replacement for Big Bad Wolf. So I went in pretty blind. Turns out the majority of the ride is a launched indoor coaster with a lot of laterals and a cool light show, themed to going into the Dark Black Forest (this totally should be the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IsHztu06kDU">theme song</a> for the ride)! Plus it also has....not gonna spoil it just in case you don't know the layout. ;) It's a lot of fun
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="verbolten2.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
And of course, it has the final drop from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWO7AYCRaxE">Big Bad Wolf</a> in tribute to it. Fun element on Verbolten, though I do wish that I was able to get on Big Bad Wolf. Oh well.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="verbolten4.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So yeah. It's a really good ride and the 2nd best Zierer coaster (just behind Wicked, and it's really close between the two of them). Happy that Verbolten was much better than I expected.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="machtower.jpeg" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
Hey look! A Mach Tower is here. These rides are really rare (as long as you've never <a href="TPRPowerPark.html">visited</a> <a href="TPRLinnemaki.html">Finland</a>). They're a lot of fun. But just like in Finland, the seats are HORRIBLY designed (We need more arm room damn it)!. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="shirt14.jpeg" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
So while on the ride, Jason went and bought me this BGW shirt since...he's a VERY giving person. Aww. Thank you. I really like it. Especially since I don't have many coaster shirts (aside from my TPR ones). =) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign778.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I would love to do one of those special tours one of these days. 
</center>
	 
<p>
<center>
<img src="fountain51.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Just one of several beautiful fountains you can find at Busch Gardens Williamsberg.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="alpengeist.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
All right. We've only done 1 of the 3 B&Ms here so far. It's time we changed that and do the B&M that intrigued me the most (and is my favorite of the 3 here).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="alpengeist2.jpeg" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
So I heard from A LOT of friends that Alpengeist was really badly trimmed and that that ruined the ride, much like Raging Bull. I'm super happy to report that that's NOT the case. =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="alpengeist3.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
The best way for me to describe Alpengeist is....it's the speed B&M Invert. It may not be the strongest, but it's still pretty strong. And this ride is FAST!!! =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="alpengeist4.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It certainly has a unique layout for a B&M Invert, and is just a ton of fun to ride. Plus, its layout is a bit more unique, and not the standard Loop, Dive Loop, Heartline Spin, Cobra Roll, Midcourse Brakes, 2nd Half, layout most B&Ms have.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="alpengeist5.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It may not be as good as Pyrenees, Montu, or Katun, but Alpengeist is still one of the best B&M Inverts and something I HIGHLY recommend.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lescoot.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Water ride break!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lescootline.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
No need to worry. That lines not as bad as it looks. Plus, it was the longest line of the day (we visited on a good day).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lescoot2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
While Escape from Pompeii was really something special, Le Scoot is not. Just a standard log flume. Not the worst, but FAR from the best.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="invadr.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Keep forgetting that this ride exists.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="statue103.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
"Grr! I'm the angry wooden Invadr statue! Gimme a better GCI Woodie!"
</center>
	 
<p>
<center>
<img src="invadr2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Invadr is a family woodie built more for families. It's a fun ride and all. It does its job brilliantly, but I'd definetly call this my least favorite GCI (at least least favorite still standing and not converted into an RMC) (I know it's not fair to compare this to the other GCIs, but...it's true). I know that's harsh, but....I can think of much better <a href="WoodenWarriorPhotos.html">family woodies</a> that would compete with the other GCIs. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="invadr3.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Jason, you are so riding this next BGW visit.
</center>
	 
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Final B&M needed at BGW.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Leering right to the edge.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon3.jpeg" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
I know this ride constantly gets compared to Sheikra since....they're sister rides. Both B&M Dive Machines at Busch Gardens parks, and both known as the best of their kind. So which is better?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon4.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I know the more common answer is Sheikra since the theming is a little better. And that is true. However, I still do give Griffon the slight edge simply because...I like that extra immelmann loop (It's close though). =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon5.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
And of course, it having normal restraints instead of the vest restraints really helps (Take that Valravn).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="griffon6.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>

SPLOOSH!!!! (I see you Alpengeist train)

While the animal selection isn't as impressive here as it is at the Sea World Parks and Busch Gardens Tampa, it still does have some animals. See. Here's a bird.

<img src="petshenanigans.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

Blah. The employees just wanted to show off their pets and find an excuse to take them to work. That's why this show exists. Because Instagram just isn't enough! =P

New at BGW for 2019 is Finnegan's Flyers. A Screamin Swing for the park. Standard Screaming Swing. Nothing special. But it's fun. And it does provide some nice views.

<center>
<img src="tea3.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So we were browsing around this shop when this Irish guy started chatting with us. He asked us where we were from, and we started talking about Ireland (I've visited A LOT of Europe, but haven't hit Ireland yet. Hoping to fit it in on the next Incrediblecoasters Europe trip) and travel in general.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="tea4.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

<center>
And of course, he showed us the different teas. Green Teas not my thing, but I loved the Irish Teas (particuarly the afternoon tea). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iO_FJ_yfuo">It's awesome!</a>

<img src="lochnessmonster.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

<center>
Hmm. I feel like we're missing something. Like there was some major coaster at the park that we still have yet to ride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster2.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Yep! We're been procrastinating long enough! Time for us to ride Loch Ness Monster!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster3.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Loch Ness Monster is the parks Arrow Looper. And...it's really fun.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster4.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It's got a lot of fun elements. But one thing on this ride really makes it stand out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster6.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Interlocking Loops. Only 3 coasters ever had them, 1.5 of them are gone (I did ride half of Lightning Loops as Diamondback @ <a href="TRTFrontierCity.html">Frontier City</a>). Loch Ness Monster is still the only coaster left with interlocking loops.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster7.jpeg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
These not only look really cool, but they have a great visual effect when actually on the ride.

Loch Ness Monster from the skyride.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster9.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Loch Ness Monster isn't just a crappy Arrow made famous because of the interlocking loops gimmick. It also has a lot of other fun elements. Like that triple indoor helix. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster10.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
And of course, the whole interlocking loops thing is great. This ride is up on par with Tennessee Tornado (Hey, I rode both rides within 3 days on this trip).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="lochnessmonster5.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

This seriously is up as one of the most beautiful coasters ever (Hmm. New Top 10 List? Nah).

It may be one of the weaker B&M Hypers, but it still has some good floater air and is a lot of fun.

So we rode this 3D Simulator ride called Battle for Erie. And....it was a lot better than I expected. Not sure if this is supposed to be the DarkKastle replacement, but it was a good show and definetly something I recommend. Thumbs up.

Good bye Busch Gardens Williamsberg. You are an amazing park, and I look foreward to returning. Especially considering how good Pantheon looks.

And of course, it's not an East Coast Trip without stopping at a Waffle House. Cheap, but good. Now have had Waffle House in 4 different states. Missouri, Oklahoma, Georgia, and now Virginia.

All right. Time for another non-coaster day on the trip (Remember, I'm traveling with a non-coaster enthusiast). Except unlike our DC day and our Pigeon Forge day, I decided that our Williamsberg day doesn't need its own mini-update and can just be part of the BGW Update.

Now once again, this wasn't my first time in Colonial Williamsberg. I had visited on that <a href="EastCoastWilliamsberg.html">Middle School Trip</a> as a kid (Oh god. I keep forgetting how old this site is, and how cringy those SUPER old updates are).

<p>
<center>
<img src="colonialwilliamsberg7.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

Yeah. I've technically been here before. But....I was a jackass teenager. So....it's MUCH better visiting as an adult and actually appreciating what you're seeing as a nerd.

OK. So one thing I remember from my teenage visit here was the resteraunt that served Peanut Soup. I really liked it, and....I wanted more of it. So...we got our order in. Now we just have to wait for our table to be called.

<p>
<center>
<img src="game11.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

So we came across this game that kids played back in colonial times because...life was very boring then. No internet, no roller coasters, no movies, no easy transportation or travelling. Better hope there's some good cliff jumping nearby. It looks stupid, but it actually was a lot of fun.

Fun random story. I was waiting for Jason outside the bathrooms when some guy walks up to me, says something along the lines of "You want this Powerade? I accidentally ordered the regular one, but I'm diabetic and can't drink it. You want it so it doesn't go to waste?". Uh...sure. Thanks random diabetic dude. =) Always love getting random surprise sports drinks.

Well, lunch time. Sadly, this place has no Peanut Soup. Turns out I ate at a different Williamsberg resteraunt. But no worries. This place is still really good. Loved that Beef Trencher. Plus, I found the <a href="https://williamsburgvisitor.com/colonial-peanut-soup/">Peanut Soup</a> recipe online and can just make it myself.

And of course, we had to have the beer sampler. Liebotshaner Cream Ale was my favorite, with Dear Old Mum Spiced Ale in a close 2nd. But don't worry. The Old Stitch Brown Ale may have been 3rd best, but it was still really good.

Yeah. The geography of Williamsberg and Jamestown is NOT impressive. DAMN YOU POCAHONTAS!!! YOU LIED TO ME!!! Seriously, if that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MuqDDwvlW1s">cliff jumping</a> spot actually existed in real life, I would've SO incorporated it onto this trip.

Well, we can't go to the beach by Jamestown (I know I'm jaded by the beaches in California, and yeah. They're not as good as the beaches in <a href="TPRFiabilandia.html">Italy</a> and <a href="Hawaii2018.html">Hawaii</a>, but it's still really nice to have easy coast access. Forgot that Virginia wasn't like that). So we just decided to a hike that we found on Yelp. Let's get exploring.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="hike13.jpeg" width="640" height="480">

The hike itself was pretty tame. Very mild. Not challenging at all. But I still had fun. Did get to see a deer. That was cool.

Turns out that we were just on some hiking trail that is part of this fancy country club, right behind the golf course. No wonder it was so tame. Give me a Tar Creek difficult hike (and some cliff jumping too) damn it! =)

And finally, we end with dinner at Moe's Grill. This is an East Coast Chain, so we had to try it out. It's good and all, but it's basically East Coast Chipotle. It tastes good, but when compared to all the great Mexican food options in So-Cal, Chipotle (and this) are basically just classier Taco Bells.
