We're here at the Walt Disney World Resort. Today, we'll be heading on over to Walt Disney Studios to go and ride Rock'N'Rollercoaster. After going in and watchng the cool preshow, you head through the line where your limo awaits. You get in, pull down the OTSRs, and we're off. We head around to a turn and go into an old alley. We get a bunch of flashing lights, including a hidden mickey as we see a countdown. This gets us prepared and ready to go. 3, 2, 1, and you launch. At one point throughout the launch, you see a bunch of cool flashing lights. Hell, it almost feels like they need a Seizure Warning for this ride, like they have to have with Pokemon and Kanye West music videos. Blugh. Thank god this ride is themed to Aerosmith, which is TREMENDOUSLY BETTER!!! Plus, they also aren't narcasisstic jackasses. Then you head up through a sea serpent roll in the dark. It's very cool being in a sea serpent roll in the dark on a Disney Coaster. Then you go through some turns and do some cool stuff while looking at some cool lights. See, while the Florida version is themed to you getting to the concert, the Paris version has you actually at the concert, so it makes a little more sense calling it Rock'N'Roller Coaster. Granted, I do like the chase of the Florida one, but I just prefer all the lights of the Paris one. Somewhere in the dark, we head through a corkscrew. When you go through it, you'll know. And then you keep seeing a bunch of pretty lights fly past you as you keep doing stuff, rocking out to Aerosmith. Finally, you end up seeing this swirling yellow light as we head into the brake run and the ride is in fact over. This is my favorite ride at Disneyland Paris and I'd highly recommend you ride it as it really kicks a lot of ass.
