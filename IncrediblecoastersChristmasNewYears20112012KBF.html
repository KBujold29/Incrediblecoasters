All right. 2011 is now gone and now we live in 2012. And in 2012, I have taken two visits to Knotts Berry Farm. Once on New Years Day, and the other a week later for a TV Shooting on Xcelerator for some Travel Channel Show. Yeah, I know its not part of the Christmas/New Years Season, but dammit!!! I didn't want a seperate update for it RIGHT after I posted this one.

Like I said before, we did a Travel Channel Shooting for a new show on Xcelerator that I'm guessing will air sometime this summer.

"So tell me. How is this ride connected to the latest raves?"
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
"I'd just like to let everyone know that this ride is vegan-friendly."
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
All right. After all that Xcelerator Goodness we filmed for the Travel Channel, its time for some more ejector air. So naturally, we rode Perilous Plunge.

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="silverbullet41.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Meh. Parts of Silver Bullet were running fine today, but other parts seemed even more forceless than usual.

Even outside Knotts Berry Farm, you can't escape the Cedar Fair Trash Cans.

Was this supposed to be a thrill ride? Cause its not. Its pleasent, its enjoyable, but its certainly not a thrill ride. Nothing about it is scary.
</center>

<center>
You know, this frisbee isn't nearly as bad as it used to me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguar17.JPG">

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogride6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And yeah. They decorated it for Christmas time. They did a good job and all, but Christmas is over guys.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogride7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Well at least they quickly undecorated it. See, now its decorated.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator51.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Dude. Xcelerator was running slow today. REALLY slow. I almost saw it roll back multiple times today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator52.JPG">
