<CENTER>I decided to spend the day at Raging Waters. </CENTER>
<P>

<CENTER>High Extreme. It looks cool doesn't it. </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="neptunesfury.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>But first Neptunes Fury. </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="neptunesfury2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>The slide snakes down the terrain. It's a pretty fun slide and it's right up there with Tiki 
Falls, Malibu Run, Sea Snake and Sidewinder. 
<CENTER>

  <img src="dropout.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  <p>Because of long lines, I was not able to ride Dropout. It looked fun though.</p>
</CENTER>

<CENTER>
  <img src="dragonsden.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>I've been waiting to see what was better. Tornado at SFHH or this. 
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="dragonsden2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Turns out Tornado was better. We got stuck and to give ourselves a push 
in the bowl. At least Raging Waters made it the bowl look mysterious. 
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="waterdrop.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>This waterdrop appears to be the Raging Waters mascot. </CENTER>

<CENTER>
  Now back to High Extreme. While it LOOKS really cool, It SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! 
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="highextreme3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  It 's basically a Supersized Surf Rider Rapids from SCPS.   So it's a real shock that the ride is THAT BAD!!!!
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="highextreme4.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
  On the positive side, the line moved very fast. See the long quene in the picture, It only took 20 min! The quene moved 
VERY fast. About as fast as California Screamin! 
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="highextreme7.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>If you're a fatass, you can't ride High Extreme. No wonder it sucks! </CENTER>

</center>
<center>The Masters of the Sky show was a hit at Raging Waters.</center>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="lilypads.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>
One thing that was unique about Raging Waters is the lilypads. It turns out that they are very cool and fun.

<CENTER>
  <img src="waterbucket.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Hey look Soak Citys! Raging Waters decorated their Water bucket! Why 
don't you do the same! </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="vortex.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Vortex. It looks like its going to pull alot of gs, but it barley pulls 
any Gs. </CENTER>

  <img src="berdumatriangle.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Berduma Triangle. A Reptile Ridge clone. It was fun as usual. </CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="highextreme5.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>I was REALLY looking foreward to this.
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
  <img src="highextreme6.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</CENTER>
<CENTER>Well, Raging Waters was overrated, but still BY FAR the best waterpark I've been to. All the stuff I was looking foreward to was Overrated. (High Extreme, Dragons Den, Dropout, Neptunes Fury), But the small stuff was really cool! (Lilypads, River Chute, Thunder River) I do recoomed this waterpark if you're in Southern California! </CENTER>
