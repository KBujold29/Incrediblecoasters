We're here at Six Flags Mexico, and we're gonna be reviewing their spinning coaster, Joker. Before you ride the ride, you go through the line. Normally, I skip this part. But the line for Joker is a LITERAL FUNHOUSE!!That honestly is super cool. Once you're done with that, you get in the seat, you pull down the lap bar, buckle the seat, and wait. Once you dispatch, you'll turn and climb up the lifthill. We then head down the first drop, and......HOLY CRAP!!! THIS THING SPINS LIKE CRAZY!!!! Plus, it's a good first drop anyways, as you gain quite a bit of speed there. But before you know it, you're curving back up, draining a lot of our speed, though it's still going fast. We then head up and go through a couple of switchbacks. And.....HOLY SH*T!!! IT JUST KEEPS SPINNING!!!! You know, it's funny. When I first rode this at its original home at Six Flags Discovory Kingdom, I felt like this ride didn't really spin much, and was dissapointed with the rides spinning. I'm not sure if they made any changes to it in Mexico, or if we just got unlucky back when it was at SFDK, but I COMPLETELY TAKE THAT BACK!!! CAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE STRONGEST SPINNING COASTERS EVER!!! GOD DAMN!!!! After the switchbacks, you then start to head into a downward spiral towards the ground. And since we're also spinning, this makes it pretty disorienting as we just twirl closer and closer to the ground. Once you make a close call with the ground, you then spin up and head on a set of trim brakes that unfortunetly slow us down. =( But at least we're still spinning. We then dip down and then head up through a tight turn. This tight turn gets us spinning even more, which is always a good thing. Then you TAKE THE FUNHOUSE!!!! Seriously, we enter a funhouse building, which features a small bunny hop. While there's no airtime, it's still really fun since we're spinning. Unfortunetly, we then hit the brakes as it's over. HOLY CRAP!!!! Joker is GREAT!!!! Not only is it really well themed by Six Flags standards, but it's also one of the strongest spinning coasters ever built. And that's always a ton of fun.
