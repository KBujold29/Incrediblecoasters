We're at Six Flags Over Texas to review their kiddy coaster (that they'll let you ride), Mini Mine Train. Yes, they actually made a minature version of Runaway Mine Train, which is an incredibly tame coaster to begin with. I don't get why they did that. Whatever. Once you get in the seat, you pull down the lap bar, and away you go! We go through some straight track, around a turn, and up a tiny little lifthill. We then head around a couple of turns and even go through a shed. This is honestly kind of like the real Runaway Mine Train. We then head through more straight track, get a GREAT view of Mr Freeze (I REALLY wish they allowed POVs so I could some GREAT Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast shots) and go down a tiny little drop that's smaller than I am. Whatever. And hey, there's a tunnel for us to take. We then head around a turn and go through a tiny little bump through a shed. WEE!!! We then go through a turn, rise up, and head into the station. Mini Mine Train has got to be the strangest kiddy coaster I have ever ridden. I mean, there's pretty much no drops and it's just turns and straight track. But honestly, Runaway Mine Train is like that. So it actually does a good job at imitating the ride it's supposed to be a miniature version of. Still a lame kiddy coaster that's truly only for credit whores.
