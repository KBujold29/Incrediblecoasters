We're here at Six Flags Over Texas and todays ride we'll be reviewing is Judge Roy Scream. Yeah, the name is weird. It's named after Judge Roy Bean, who was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Bean">unusual judge</a>. Hey, considering how scary some of the judges in the South are, he doesn't seem that bad. I can think of a MUCH WORSE <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Moore">Judge Roy</a> *barf*. This is the parks wooden coasters, one of the oldest coasters at the park, and it's a fun little ride. I was expecting this to be a cruiser snoozer, but I actually had fun on this ride. So let's just hop in the trains, pull down the lap bars, and away we go. We go through some straight track and around a turn before heading up the lifthill. This gives us a good view of the lake on the other side as well as a nearby hotel. Eventually, we reach the top and the ride can now begin. We head down the first drop, which while it isn't crazy, it's a fun little first drop and does provide us with some good speed. Yeah, there's a little bit of jackhammering at the bottom of the first drop, but it's no big deal. We then rise into the first airtime hill, which doesn't have any airtime. We just rise up, get a pleasant view as we slow down at the top, and drop back down again. Wee. We then head straight into two more airtime hills. And hey. We have floater air. We rise into the first airtime hill, get some floater air. Go through the second one, float out of our seats again. See, it's not a cruiser snoozer. =) Now I can say "Wee!!" and not be sarcastic. Yeah, there's a little bit of shuffling at the bottom, but I am having fun at this point. We rise up another hill, which sadly, also has no airtime. We then head around a turn, and get what's actually a really nice view of Six Flags Over Texas since Judge Roy Scream just sticks out of the park. We then dip back down and the back portion of this out and back can begin. We rise through another airtime hill. Yeah, there's a little airtime, but some laterals as well since we turn at the bottom of this hill. Fun. We then head into Hill #1. Wee. Airtime! =) Hill #2. No airtime since this is a bigger hill. But I'm still having fun. We then duck under the supports and go through a tiny little hill. BOOM!!! A pop of ejector air. I enjoyed that. We then rise up, take the shed, and glide straight into the brake run. So yeah. That's Judge Roy Scream. Nothing crazy, but a fun little out and back woodie that actually has some nice pops of airtime. If you have the time, give it a ride while visiting Six Flags Over Texas.
