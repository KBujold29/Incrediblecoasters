</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another trip. We had already visited Lagoon earlier <a href="UCTLagoon15.html">this year</a> and had a blast. Well, they just opened up Cannibal for 2015, we have season passes, and of course, we had to go back. Because yeah. Lagoon is just awesome. Anyways, call Chris for your test strips all you diabetics. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="saltlakecity3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Happy to be back here in Salt Lake City.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="playground.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Story time. When we were driving through Salt Lake City a couple months ago, we stumbled across this playground and wanted to stop, but couldn't for time. So Cody decided that we would come here in July. And, here we are.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="playground2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. I miss those spinning things. I have fond memories of these things being in Ventura and am still not happy that they got removed here. Well, at least they're still here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="grafitti7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kim Jong Un is officially endoresed by Salt Lake City. Who knew. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="playground3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It may just be a playground, but I had fun here for about 15 minutes. Fun little stop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign406.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for the real reason we came back here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know that I'll talk about Cannibal in far greater detail down below, but let me just say now that Cannibal is really freaking good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I will admit that it wasn't *quite* as crazy as I was hoping. But screw it!!! It runs beautifully, is still a ton of fun, fits in BEAUTIFULLY with Lagoon, and is just an overall great ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love the look of the station. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="samauri5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's get this day started with one of the craziest and more underrated flat rides out there, Samurai.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon15.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So glad that Lagoon is taking care of these classic rides that are sadly becoming rare.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wildmouseLAGOON6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Be careful guys. This is one of the more brutal Wild Mouse coasters out there. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign407.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ha. Looks like the lap bar is his dick. Yes, I am immature. No, I don't give a f*ck.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tiger2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey tiger. Cheer up. Yeah, the caged life isn't that good, but at least you're at Lagoon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage19.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to head back into Pioneer Village.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="icecreamshop.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But first, let's stop for Ice Cream.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="icecream13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you've been debating about whether you should get a cup or cone, have no fear. At Lagoon, you get both.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="peacock6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Back in the olden days, we had these creatures called Peacocks roam the streets.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage20.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I keep coming back here every time I come to Lagoon, and I keep finding cool stuff to take pictures of. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage21.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh...no. That's not what my work space looks like.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage22.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Someone over here really liked building model trains.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="map.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh look. I'm back home in Ventura. Joy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyscraperLAGOON4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyone care to go for a spin?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love these ariel shots of Cannibal. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You notice how the second inline twist actually goes in the opposite direction as the first one? Yeah, it's a really funky and crazy element.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="canniballine.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. That Cannibal line isn't nearly as bad as it seems.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="lagoon12.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lagoon from the top of the ferris wheel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="paratrooperLAGOON.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I don't mind taking a ride on this classic flat ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign408.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Am I the only one thinking of a <a href="XPhotos.html">certain coaster</a> right now? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Spider is still running great as usual. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyrideLAGOON6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure why the skyride here is so good, but it just is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="watercannon.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Water cannons on Rattlesnake Rapids? JACKPOT!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rattlesnakerapids5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Mormon Pink Sweater Girl! Think fast! Though really, she's screwed even if we don't blast her. That waterfall will get her regardless. >=)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="river13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. The river is dried up again. You know, I'm starting to sense a pattern. Both times we visited in May, the river was flowing. And both times we visited in July, the river was dried up. Guess this is a seasonal river.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bear3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. That's no big deal. I know plenty of bears that'll be happy to let me sit on them. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="merchandise25.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We are terrible people.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jumpingdragon.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, this dragon ride was actually much stronger than I was anticipating.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good luck. You're going to need it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELIX OF DEATH!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rocket4.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
You know, I may not be a big fan of the S&S Towers, but this was still a really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rocket5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ready for Blast Off!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster16.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Do not underestimate the wooden coaster at Lagoon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster17.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may look plain and ordinary, but it's actually got some great airtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal11.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's go for some more rides on Cannibal. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal12.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cannibal may look intimidating, but it just blends in with the park PERFECTLY. A perfect fit for Lagoon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Definetly make sure to check it out and give it a ride when visiting Lagoon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="alpineslidePARKCITY.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we had a fun day at Lagoon. The next day, we decided to head over to Park City and check out all the cool Alpine Coasters and other fun stuff.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="alpinecoasterPARKCITY.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
While I didn't do the Alpine Slide (Financial Lockdown), I did manage to do the Alpine Coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="alpinecoasterPARKCITY2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love Alpine Coasters and am really excited to be riding another one today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="alpinecoasterPARKCITY3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This one really takes you deep in the mountains and has a great layout.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="alpinecoasterPARKCITY4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm having a hard time deciding if I prefer this Alpine Coaster or the one at Fort Fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign409.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and this place once hosted the Winter Olympics. I'm impressed that this place didn't become a ghost town like so many <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_19733_5-things-they-dont-want-you-to-know-about-olympics.html">other places that hosted the Olympics.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="waterfillingstation.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you know me, then you know that I HATE bottled water with a passion. So I am extremely happy to see these refilling stations taking off.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="waterfillingstation2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The more pollution we stop by not buying what we can get for free, plus a bunch of unnecesarry waste, the better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="parkcity2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Park City is just a great town to walk around in.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="summerskijump.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We were just driving around, planning on heading back, and we just stumbled upon the Olympic Park and saw the Summer Ski Jump.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="summerskijump2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HOLY CRAP! THAT LOOKS SO AWESOME!!! If it wasn't for the stupid f*cking drought, I'd petition to have one of these built in Ventura (Great, now it's ruining this as well as cliff jumping). I can certainly tell you that Ski Jumping would be a big hobby of mine if that was built in Ventura (I'd like to get into Skiing, but it's expensive, I'm poor, and I have enough expensive intrests and hobbies as it is).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyrideLAGOON7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well that was fun. Let's head back to Lagoon for the night and a couple more rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, let's take another ride on Lagoon's newest ride and my personal favorite in the park, Cannibal.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="theming.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love little touches like that where they theme the line supports to be like trees.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="cannibal15.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Again, it's not crazy intense, but it's just a ton of fun. Kind of like a lot of B&Ms these days.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="elloco9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, while heading back, we had to stop in Vegas for more fun on El Loco.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="elloco10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I actually didn't ride El Loco this time thanks to financial lockdown. Yeah, it's a bummer since I really like the ride. But I did ride it a couple months ago, so it's not a big deal.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="trumptower.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I could go on and on about just how disasterous and pants-sh*ttingly terrifying Donald Trump as president would be and go and about what I think of him, but I can save myself and everyone else time by revealing my thoughts on Trump with one swift flick of my middle finger.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manhattenexpress6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dylan wasn't quite sure if Cody and I were exaggerating when we say that Manhattan Expess is really that bad, so Cody took him on it to show him just how Manhattan Express runs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="manhattenexpress7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELL NO!!! I did NOT ride Manhurtin Express. If I'm going to pay an outrageous amount of money to ride a roller coaster, I would've just ridden El Loco since unlike Manhattan Express, I actually LIKE that ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="800degreespizza.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we met up with John, and he introduced us to 800 degrees Pizza. A great pizza place. Definetly my favorite Pizza Place that isn't in either New York City or Rome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="shakeshack.jpg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And we stopped for shakes at Shake Shack afterwards, cause yeah. It's really good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="mgmarena.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
John, your life is going to be so busy when they finally finish the arena at MGM.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="traffic.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And when we were on our way home, we got stuck in the WORST traffic ever. No really, this was by far, the WORST traffic I had ever been in, crushing my old record. Over on the 15, right around Baker, traffic just came to a standstill. This was so bad that we actually parked our car, and walked around the freeway. It was like that episode of Malcolm in the Middle where they all get stuck in a non-moving traffic jam coming home from Wild Rivers (R.I.P. and F*CK YOU IRVINE COMP!!!). Yeah, it was like that, except we're not nearly that crazy. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="traffic2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey! It's not that bad! I can sit on the car, wave at people, run around, play frisbee with an old frisbee that some stupid kid probably threw away, and pee in front of traffic on the other side of the freeway!". But seriously, I'm glad that I was with friends and could make the best of the situation cause I know I would've gotten angry and been miserable had I been stuck in this alone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="traffic3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Screw it! This is taking too long! I'm rolling back to Ventura! I'm happy I went back to Lagoon, Cannibal is awesome, Lagoon keeps proving itself to be awesome, and I might or might not go back in October. I'll see how everything plays out.
