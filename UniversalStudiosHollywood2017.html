All right. Time for another update. And it's time for us to head back to a park that may be in So-Cal, but we very rarely go to. Yep. We're back at Universal Studios Hollywood. Now Universal is a park we don't visit too often partially because the park is mostly simulators, but mainly, it's because of money. I was reminded today of just how f*cking expensive this place is. And yeah. Universal Studios Hollywood is a once in a while park. It's really fun to visit once in a while, but its a place you burn out of pretty quickly. I know I hadn't visited the park since <a href="UniversalStudiosHollywood11.html">2011</a>, and yeah. This place has certainly changed. And yet, it hasn't. Yeah, they've added A LOT of new rides in the time span. But it still essentially feels like the same park. I know the park added a lot since my last visit, but I knew that they were building the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, and said that I'd wait for that. I could wait Transformers out. And then it eventually opened, but thanks to financial lockdown, I procrastenated to getting back out here (It's hard to justify coming here at the prices). But I knew that the time had come. So let's come and check out the park.
</center>

<p>

<img src="metaldetectors2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just need to make sure no one is going to commit suicide in the park today (though Seriously. I'm happy that they don't have the metal detectors on the rides like they do in Florida). =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="universalstudioshollywood4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I sure hope you like motion simulators, cause you're going to be riding a lot of them today. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign497.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Ooh! Hollywood Magic!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hogsmade.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's start out with the newest attraction here, as well as what drove us to come back here. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hogsmade2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hey Celeste and Allie! I made it out to Harry Potter world. I know you both want to come here considering what die-hard Potterheads you both are. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="forbiddenjourney.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. Let's talk about their newest dark ride. Forbidden Journey. Yeah, this ride takes you through Hogwarts. You fly through a Quidditch Match, fight dementors, and those killer trees. But what I really want to talk about is how this is a dark ride that uses the same technology as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKR3nwf6_0M">Knights Tournament</a> and other Robot Arms, which are on our <a href="Top10FlatRides.html">Top 10 Flat Rides</a>. So I was really excited to see what this technology could do. And while Forbidden Journey is a lot of fun, don't go in expecting Level 5 flipping. You won't get it. And while it's still a really good simulator, it's not Spiderman good. Sorry. Still really like Forbidden Journey.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="forbiddenjourney2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All are welcome on Forbidden Journey. Except for Slytherins. We don't tolerate their kind around here. Yeah, I admit it. I'm housist. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flightofthehippogriff.jpg">
</center>
<center>
But while Forbidden Journey is the big new ride for the Wizarding World, don't forget. They also added Flight of the Hippogriff. YAY!!! New credit!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flightofthehippogriff2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. This is weird. It's a Mack Youngstar. Fine with me, I really like the standard <a href="PegasusEUROPAPhotos.html">Mack Youngstar</a>. But the layout is exactly that of the big Roller Skater from Vekoma. Is there a reason you couldn't just get a big Vekoma Roller Skater and had to resort to having Mack make it? It's fine. Just a nerdy observation. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flightofthehippogriff3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hey. I just realized. I think this the first time my first coaster of the year was also a new credit. Yeah. It is. Fun little fact. =) 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="flightofthehippogriffline.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Are you worried that people just aren't riding your Roller Skater? Worried that you'll be spotted as a credit whore? Have no fear. Just theme it to Harry Potter and the people will come. 
</center>

<img src="escelator6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. That's enough Harry Potter. Time to head on down to the lower level.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="escelator7.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Seriously. You lazy people need to take the stairs on down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="transformers.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Time for the other big attraction they added since I last came. Transformers. And I can tell you. I was super happy to be riding another ride that uses the Spiderman technology. While I will admit that it's not quite as good as Spiderman, it's still really good and will totally land a spot on our <a href="Top10DarkRides.html">Top 10 Dark Rides</a>.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="transformers2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And don't worry. You don't see Devestators balls on the ride (WHY DID THEY THINK THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA IN TRANSFORMERS 2!!? WHY!!?).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="revengeofthemummy.JPG">
</center>
<center>
OK. Let's get back to a ride that isn't new for me. Revenge of the Mummy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="revengeofthemummy4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
It may not be as good as Florida Mummy, but it's still a really good ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="revengeofthemummy5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
That anti-climactic ending still pisses me off! Seriously, this is worse than Adventure Express @ Kings Island.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jurassicpark4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And of course, we have to ride Jurassic Park while visiting Universal Studios.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jurassicpark5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Nice T-Rex. I want to pet the T-Rex.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign498.jpg">
</center>
<center>
You mean I can't pet the T-Rex? Lame. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign499.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Just a quick reminder that hats are from the devil.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jurassicpark6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I didn't think they had boats like that 65 million years ago.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="jurassicpark7.jpg">
</center>
<center>
DAMN IT!!! I actually got wet on Jurassic Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign500.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Oh god. WHY!!? I was never a fan of this show as I've always found reality TV to be stupid, especially polished celebrity garbage like this. Always hated it. But now...Ugh. I can't think of this show without feeling sick. Sorry, but this show pretty much now has ties to bigotry, fascism, and sexual assault. And of course, they have to get another actor gone government. No, that's not fair. Arnold Schwarzenegger > Fuhrer von F*ckface X 1,000,000. Still, keeping this show is terrible. PLEASE don't tell me that people are watching this crap!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="la2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I will admit this. I really do love the view and the setting of Universal Studios Hollywood.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supersillyfunland.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Finally, there's one last new attraction that they've added to the park since my last visit. Hell, they added a new land. And that ride is...
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="despicablememinionmayhem.jpg">
</center>
<center>
*groan* Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem (Why are these movies popular?).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="christmastree14.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hey Universal Studios. It's January (I totally understand wanting to pretend it's not, but it sadly is). Take the Christmas Tree down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="despicablememinionmayhem2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Now as you can tell, I'm no fan of Despicable Me. OK, I technically can't say that since I've actually never seen a Despicable Me movie. But I have seen all the ads, I saw that Banana short, and I'm just going to flat out say it. The minions f*cking annoy me (which is why I haven't seen any of the movies). Maybe I'm unfairly judging these movies, but every time these little obnoxious yellow creatures appeared in a short or a commercial, they irritated me. A LOT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="despicablememinionmayhem3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
No really. They know the minions are obnoxious. They brag about it while in their "How to be a Minion". Just look at the options they listed and which one is the one a minion would do in that situation (Spoiler. It's C). Yeah. Some will argue that I need to see a Despicable Me movie before judging. And who knows. I might enjoy it even though everything I've seen so far indicates that I'd just find it annoying. I'll watch movies on my to watch list that don't sound annoying fist. ;) 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="despicablememinionmayhem4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
"I may not be a minion, but I'm going to try and be as obnoxious as one!" =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sillyswirly.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Random new kiddy ride in the Despicable Me land.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. I have to talk about this. Universal Studios Hollywood was doing a by popular demand of <a href="http://insideuniversal.net/2016/12/from-coraline-to-kubo-a-magical-laika-experience-returns-to-universal-studios-hollywood/">the Laika Experience: From Coraline to Kubo</a>. It was a special event that was only avaliable for the Holiday Season. While I normally am annoyed by Holiday stuff in January, this isn't connected to any specific holiday, so I'm perfectly fine with this being up in January (Sadly, it's gone now, but I'm glad that I got to see it). I really hope that they bring it back by popular demand again because this is super cool. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
"Grr! Ready to the Laika Experience!" =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. First up, they showed the actual dolls from Coraline.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Now Coraline is the only movie from Laika that I've seen (though I've heard great things about ParaNorman and Kubo and hope to see both soon). And Coraline is awesome. If you haven't seen it, check it out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
"GAH! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU OTHER MOTHER!!? Is this because I refused to have the buttons sewn on my eyes!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience10.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. Moving onto the figures from ParaNorman.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Love the idea of the movie and really hope to check it out soon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience7.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I know it just looks like a play set right here. But this is actually literally the set of the movie. That's it right there. Freaking cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience8.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Why is your van the same size as your bed Norman? =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience9.jpg">
</center>
<center>
But yeah. All of these figures are the actual puppets you see in the Laika movies. That's just really freaking cool.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience11.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And here, they're showing off the stuff from their less known film, "The Boxtrolls". Don't know much about it, but I'm probably going to see ParaNorman and Kubo first.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience12.jpg">
</center>
<center>
"I walk down the stairs like a sir."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience13.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. Let's talk about the animation here. Now Laika does stop motion films with these figures. The film is actually just shot with a still camera. But they take 30 shots for every second of film, so it's pretty much animated in the same way you'd animate any other movie. And if you've ever animated (I have some experience with Adobe After Effects as well as Adobe Animate), mouths are a HUGE pain in the ass. And you can totally see just how many mouth peices they have for the figures to make them talk.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience14.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. We're finally going to look at their newest film, Kubo. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience15.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Again, just showing you these really cool figurines. These are the real deal.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience17.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. I know all the figures have been really so far. But this one is actually huge. 
</center>
<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience18.jpg">
</center>
<center>
No really! Just look at it compared to everything else!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="laikaexperience16.jpg">
</center>
<center>
So that was the Laika Exhibit. I really am glad I got to check it out while it was still here. It's really cool, and shows off a great film company. I really hope they bring it back to Universal Studios so that more people can see it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="universalstudioshollywood5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. We're back in the park. Let's go explore it some more.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="walkingdead.jpg">
</center>
<center>
I love the yearround Haunt mazes. And it totally makes sense that they'd have one themed to "The Walking Dead" here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="christmastree15.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Hey look. Universal heard my Christmas Tree complaint and is taking it down. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="hogsmade3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Of course I've seen him! He's right in front of me you idiot! You're literally showing me his picture! =P
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="threebroomsticks.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for lunch. And yeah. We have to go and see what Universal did food-wise to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. So let's check out the Three Broomsticks resteraunt.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="threebroomsticks2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. So the resteraunt is essentially just British food trying to pass off as Wizard food (But it's OK, because Harry Potter is British). Bangers and Mash is good, and it's unique for theme park food. But I can think of better theme park food when you include all the really good stuff served at European parks, plus Silver Dollar City, Dollywood, and Disney parks. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="butterbeer.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And of course, you have to try the Butterbeer (as you saw during my food photo).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="butterbeer2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
All I have to say about Butterbeer is...I hope you like butterscotch. Cause this drink is essentially just pure butterscotch soda. Let me tell you. The head is by far the best part. The soda itself is all right. But the foam, which is normally the part you ignore in actual beer. In Butterbeer, it's the best part and is what makes the drink (though at the prices they serve it, I won't be buying another one simply due to cost).
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="candyshop2.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And of course, they have the candy shop from Hogsmade here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="chocolatefrog.jpg">
</center>
<center>
If I kiss a chocolate frog, do I then get a chocolate prince?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="studiotour7.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Eh. Just don't have the time to spend an hour on the Studio Tour today. Oh well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="shrek4D3.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Meh. This 4D show plot may not make much sense, but at least it's still better than Shrek 3.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="shrek4D5.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Quick. Tell me the difference between the Harry Potter bricks and the Shrek bricks.
</center>

"Stop filling my swamp!!"

<center>
For those of you curious about how special effects work.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="simpsonsride4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I know the Simpsons have been on the air for way too long and think it needs to be cancelled (I still really like this simulator though). But on the bright side, at least it didn't go down the route that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=US7XNfp3QsI">Family Guy</a> went, which is much worse.

</center>
<center>
Eh. One of these days, I'll really check out Citywalk and see what all it has to offer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="universalstudioshollywood6.jpg">
</center>
<center>
So yeah. That was Universal Studios Hollywood. While it added a lot of new attractions, including the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, it does ultimately feel like the same park. Still glad I came out and check it out. I'm not sure exactly when my next visit will be, but I certainly hope that they add something new then.
