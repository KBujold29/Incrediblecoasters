All right. We may have already took two visits to Knotts Berry Farm <a href="IncrediblecoastersChristmasNewYears20112012KBF.html">this year.</a> But this is our first official update of the year as well as our first visit to Six Flags Magic Mountain for the year. Chad was out from Oklahoma, so a bunch of us went over to SFMM to hang out together and we had a blast.
