We're heading back in time to review Pacific Spin. Pacific Spin was a Tornado Clone. However, this was better than Tornado because this had the BONUS HELIX!!!  Ok, time for the review. After climbing up the stairs with your bigass four person tubes, you reached the top, got comfortable in your tube until the lifeguard pushed your tube into the darkness. It felt weird going through the first turn, hoping that you'd spin so you faced backwards for the drop. But then you realized something funny. The light to the drop isn't there. After that moment of confusion, you kept spinning in the dark. Then after a few seconds, you saw that light. And then you dropped. It was a fun Tornado Drop, then you went up high in the funnel, only to come back down and do it again. Then rinse and repeat until you reached the end. Oh yeah, Pacific Spin had one more suprise. Before you hit the pool, you went through a water curtain. So yeah, it was Tornado. Except a little higher, had a bonus helix, a water curatin, and is pink. I highly would've recommend riding this back when it was at Soak City
