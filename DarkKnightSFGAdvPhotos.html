We're here at Six Flags Great Adventure where we'll reveiwing the Dark Knight. Now when you hear the words "Dark Knight Rollercoaster", you think "Wow. Dark Knight was a kickass action packed movie!! So therefor, this is going to be a kickass action packed rollercoaster." So after waiting in the long line (Or skipping it via QBot), we head into the Preshow Room. Now, the preshow kicks ass. It feels like the movie and really makes you think what this ride is going to be like. Then after going through more line, you eventually reach the cars. After getting in the seats and pulling down the lap bar, you go up the lifthill. While climbing the lifthill, you wonder what sort of ride this will be like. Then once we get to the top, you get whipped around a turn and set into the switchbacks. We then realize "They themed a common Wild Mouse to the Dark Knight? DAMMIT!!!! THAT DOESN'T FIT!!!!" The switchbacks are fun, but not the action the name makes you expect. But at least in the switchbacks, there's a little bit of theming. Then after going through the set of switchbacks, you are set off into a nice big turn that just pins you to the side the entire time. Then unfortunetly, there are some trim brakes before the big drop, but that's ok. Then you turnaround only to go through the rides biggest drop. While it's not a very big drop. It's still fun. And yeah, at this point, it's just a Wild Mouse in a box. No theming, No Batman, just an ordinary Wild Mouse in a big box. Then you meet another set of trim brakes, Then you come through another turnaround where we head towards the end of the ride. after another small drop, we head into the extra hump. At this point, pretty much over as we turn into a final dip into the brake run. While I can't say that Dark Knight is a bad ride, because I had fun on it. But the whole thing just decieves you. And like I said, the theme doesn't go well.I'd recommend skipping it due to the ridicously long line that this ride usually gets. Because while it's a good Wild Mouse, it's still a Wild Mouse.
