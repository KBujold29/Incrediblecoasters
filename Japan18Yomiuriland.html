</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another Tokyo adventure. Just strolling around, enjoying this lovely Japanese day. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="fishstore.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey you! Wanna see what we dragged out of the ocean this morning!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyo12.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder where we're heading today?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyo13.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ugh. We really could've used this covered pathway back when we were here on Tuesday. Oh crap. I think I just gave it away.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're back at the Senso-ji Temple this morning.  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanayashiki2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's a beautiful sunny day today. That means it's time to go back to Hanayashiki and get that credit!  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="hanayashiki3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
God damn it! Nearly all the rides are down today for maintenence! Ugh. Well, at least I have another week in Japan. I'll just come back later when all this maintenence is done.  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we might as well just explore the temple in much greater detail. Yeah, we explored it a little on Tuesday in the rain, but we were primarily just trying to stay dry. It'll be good to look at it in further detail. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="river19.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The river is a really nice touch to this temple.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I definetly like the dragon architecture they have here.  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign679.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So what this really is is another monument to Buddah (Well duh! We're in a buddhist temple you dumbass!). If you really want more details, you can read them here,
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="bridge17.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There's nothing special or fancy about this bridge. I just really like it. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. There's a nice historic temple right here. What could make this better? Oh I know! Let's have an S&S Space Shot in the background! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. This is actually the oldest temple in Tokyo. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It may not be as good as the really famous temples in Kyoto, it's still a really nice temple.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji10.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap. I keep forgetting that this is actually a religous place (I already covered this in the Tokyo Joypolis update). Sh*t! People are praying in here! I should probably get out of here! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue61.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ROAR!!! BLASPHEMOUS IRRELIGOUS HERATIC!!! CONVERT TO BUUDHISM OR ELSE I'M GONNA F*CKING EAT YOU!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="sensoji11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey park map enthusiasts! You have the Senso-ji map in your collection? I didn't think so. =P 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="tokyo11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Where to have lunch today? So many good local places to choose from.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="gyozasakura.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I want Gyoza today, but they're not open yet! NO!!! ='( 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="panas.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I'm all the way out in Japan. So many good food options to choose from. I know! Let's eat the cuisine from another country today!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch84.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So yeah. We're having Indian food today. Which....is good. I really like Indian food. And I rarely have it back home. So it fits.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="drummuseum.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What do we have over here?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="drummuseum2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So yeah. I came across a drum museum. I've got some time. Screw it. I'm gonna check this place out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="drummuseum3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's a shame there's no photography allowed in the actual museum because this place is really cool. Who knew learning about different drums from around the world would be so interesting. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="trainstation.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh! This train stop is decorating all its Christmas Lights. Pretty! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture147.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. We're only at the Yomiuriland train stop, and already, Land Dog (the park mascot) is welcoming us to the park.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiuriland2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to Yomiuriland!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiuriland.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's a park map just in case you get lost.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiuriland3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I spy with my little eyes, a Christmas tree that's out of season.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue62.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So Land Dog is this weird....dog. He doesn't look like any park mascot (or cartoon dog) I've ever seen. But I really like him. And apparently, you can learn all about Land Dog <a href="http://www.yomiuriland.com.e.ym.hp.transer.com/good_and_lucky/">here</a>.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. First things first, time to ride Bandit.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditline2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Crap! This ride actually has a line (Fun fact. This is the only line in the park)!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditline.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. They've really decked out all the Christmas lights here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture148.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No ducks are allowed on Bandit.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* We're riding Bandit!? NO!!! I don't want to ride one of the <a href="Top10WorstCoasters.html">worst coasters ever</a>!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
LOL. Yomiriland Bandit may not be the best ride ever by any means, but compared to that peice of sh*t at Movie Park Germany, this ride is freaking Steel Vengeance by comparison. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So Bandit is a sort of....Togo Mini Hyper. It's not quite a hyper coaster. But then again, if things like Mega-Lites, or even Steel Eel count, then I guess Bandit should count since it's about the same size (Bandit isn't a hyper coaster, regardless of the loopholes I mentioned).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bandit may not be anything special, but it does have a lot of speed, a couple pops of airtime, some cool helixes, and is another smooth as glass Togo. So yeah. It may not stand out, but it's still a fun roller coaster.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. So the reason you see all these Christmas Lights everywhere is because Yomiuriland is holding their own Illumination, despite it not only being November, but EARLY November.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wanwancoasterwandit.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let's just knock this out of the way.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wanwancoasterwandit3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
As a kiddy coaster, it's whatever. Standard run of the mill.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wanwancoasterwandit2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But Holy Crap!!! All those lights!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wanwancoasterwandit4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When Yomiuriland goes all out on Christmas, even the kiddy coaster gets the holiday treatment.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="wanwancoasterwandit5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bling. Bling. Cha-Ching. Cha-Ching.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="momongastandingandloop.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. What is the Momonga Standing & Loop?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="momongastandingandloop2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. It's the coaster with both a stand up train as well as a sit-down train. And of course, we're choosing to stand up.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="momongastandingandloop3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Standing (or sitting) with the Christmas Lights.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="loopingstarshipYOMIURI.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OH GOD!!! NO!!! NOT THIS RIDE!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="loopingstarshipYOMIURI2.jpeg" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. This evil ride has managed to find its way in Japan. Not happy about that.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. So pretty much all sorts of places in the Tokyo area compete in something called Winter Illumination, where they try and outdo each other in terms of Christmas Lights.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know how all the whos decorate their houses in that really cartoonish extravegant way in How the Grinch Stole Christmas? This is the real life version of that.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination12.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So pretty *drool*.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. The S&S Tower would not only let me see all the pretty lights, but get a thrill too. Win win situation.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="crazyzoomcrazyboom.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I wonder if the S&S Tower is open today?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="diskoYOMIURI.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Apparently, this Disk-O is the new 2018 ride for Yomiuriland. Hey, it's a fun addition and I'm happy I stopped to ride it.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="giantskyriver.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I had no idea what this was at the time. Apparently, this is one of those spinning raft rides. Fun, but in this weather, nope.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Yomiuriland! It's November! Take down your Christmas....HOLY SH*T!!! THOSE LIGHTS ARE SO PRETTY!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination22.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So this is a Christmas sledding hill, where you can slide down the hill on a tube amongst all the lights. So cool!  
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey kids! Scram! This is our slide now!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Sh*t! All the lights are so pretty! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture149.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No Mr. Seal! Eat the fishy! Don't eat poor Land Dog!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When Yomiuriland decided to decorate for Christmas, they went FULL BALLS OUT nuts.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="stairs10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Maybe if we cover the stairs with Christmas Lights, we can trick people into taking the stairs. Oh wait. We don't need to do that. We're in Japan. Not America.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Much like at Tobu Zoo, Yomiuriland also has the Christmas Lights grass here too.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Crap! I loved the Winter Illumination they had at Tobu Zoo, but....DAMN!!! Yomiuriland just knocked it out of the park!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination15.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I don't think I'm ever gonna speak highly of Holiday in the Park again. Sorry Six Flags. I know you're trying, but after this, you just can't compete.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They just decorated so much! It's kind of incredible! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This nature is not pretty enough! Throw on some pretty shiny lights! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiuriland4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. We're idiots. Where the hell is Spin Runway!? I've been walking all around this park, but could never find it!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinrunway.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*facepalm* Right in the front of the park! God damn it! It's just like at Parue Espana all over again! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinrunway2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Crap! This ride is good! Really good! It spins like crazy and it's better than freaking Bandit (which really surprised me). Hell, I'd call it my 4th favorite spinner (#1. Winjas #2. Tornado @ Bakken #3. Gekion: Live Coaster).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinrunway3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The ride is themed to being inside a fashion factory. However, the fashion factory is far more like a disco and a night club. It's like if Land Dog collaberated with Lady Gaga to make a spinning coaster. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinrunway4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let's have some fun. This beat is sick. I wanna take a ride on your disco stick. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="santa3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see all these amazing Christmas Lights at Yomiuriland and this is the best you can do for a Santa!? For shame. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination21.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm so entranced by all the pretty lights here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner33.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So I decided that for dinner, I thought that a Doner Kebab and a beer would be the best thing to have. Hey Cliff. You like my dinner? =) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI6.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. We need more rides on Bandit.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI7.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What's that? You liked the spinning coaster more than me!? Well how about I spice up the ride with some FIRE!!!! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI8.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bandit is fun and all, but I just love the way that the park even decorated it for the Yomiuriland Illuminations.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="banditYOMIURI9.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ho ho ho! Christmas Bandit rolls on by!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination16.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There aren't enough lights here! Add more! 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="gokartsYOMIURI.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh look. They have go-karts here.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="gokartsYOMIURI2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. Wound up not doing it, but driving amongst all the lights would be really cool.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="yomiurilandillumination8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You think all the christmas lights on the Go-Kart track is causing distracted driving?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="laserathleticspharostrap.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So this is a sort of laser shooting game. However, the attendents were hesitant to have me play since they figured that I wouldn't understand the game at all. But I insisted. And sure enough, the bare minimum amount of Japanese I know is not enough and I wound up not understanding the game at all, scoring almost no points, and making a total ass of myself. 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
  <img src="momongastandingandloop4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know it's not a new credit. But I think it's only fair that we give the sit down a side a fair chance on the Standing & Loop.
</center>
	
<p>

OK. Putting aside the uniqueness of standing or sitting, this is a very dull ride.

I feel like this the sort of coaster that you'd build in an RCT Tutorial on "How to build a stand up coaster", where you make a coaster with the bare essentials of a coaster, first drop, loop, helix, the end. Only they decided to also add a sit down train for those who don't like standing up. It's certainly unique, but it's very much a novelty credit.

Love all the blue they use to decorate that tree.

Decorating all the trees with lights isn't enough! We need to also construct a whole seperate tree entirely from lights!

OK. I love Land Dog. He's probably one of my favorite custom park mascots. I kind of wish I got some Land Dog merchandise. Oh well. It's not like I need more crap. And besides, I can just come back and get it next time.

Unfortunetly, my phone is about to die, and my back-up camera is already dead. So no Christmas photos from the Ferris Wheel today. =(

Well Yomiuriland, it was really fun visiting you. You're a very odd and quirky park, but I still really liked stopping by.
