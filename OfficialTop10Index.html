Welcome to the Official Incrediblecoasters Top 10 Index. Here, we have links to all our Top 10 Lists. Now many of you may think, why have entire pages just devoted to a Top 10 List? Well, unlike most places, we at Incrediblecoasters actually take the time to actually explain why X ride got the #1 spot and why Y ride is only at the #7 spot. Most people don't do that. They just go. Here's my Top 10 List, and then list it without any explenation why each ride or park is where it is at. Now normally, this is fine since most people are just listing their Top 10 Lists in a Your Top 10 List Thread of a roller coaster forum. But then there are certain Top 10 Lists that I HATE and they drive me insane. Now you can have Dragon or Gouderix on your Top 10 List and I won't care. I might think you're crazy and/or a sadomasachist, but people are free to form their own opinions and I don't mind that. What annoys me is when people don't back up their opinions. Prove to me WHY you think that Gouderix is your favorite coaster!!!! Here you are, making this sh*tty Youtube Top 10 List and it doesn't even contain why the #1 spot is #1 etc. It makes you look lazy, and when your list is just repeating everyone elses, you look like a liar and a copycat who doesn't even know what they're talking about with these rides. Well, that's why I came up with the Incrediblecoasters Top 10 Lists. We not only actually explain our positions, but we do lists for as much as possible instead of just the usual Top 10 Roller Coasters and the Top 10 Theme Parks.

While Wooden Coasters may have the reputation of being old, rusty, and ancient, Steel Coasters have the reputation of being the new, hip, and modern bad boy on the block. And while not all of them are like that, not all of them need to be like that. Check out what Top 10 Steel Coasters have the ability to do and what makes these rides world class.

While some of the worlds greatest roller coasters are great and all, you have to give credit to the homes that these bad boys live in. Amusement Parks are home to many other insane fun things to do besides insane roller coasters and we have to honor them for that. Now it's difficult to compare different amusement parks because ranking them without any consideration is like comparing apples to oranges to papayas to carrots to bacon to jelly doughnuts. But we'll do it anyways. These are the Top 10 Amusement Parks to visit to.

When most people think of theme park food, they think of all the typical amusement park crap that most parks serve, which while not bad, does get old after visiting theme parks all the time. However, there are much more dining options to many theme parks besides typical amusement park crap. And this Top 10 List will introduce you to 10 theme parks across the country where you should eat at. So go get a snack, since you'll be hungry after hearing all the tasty options these parks have.

We don't spend very much time watching shows at theme parks, because, well...most of them aren't that good. But there are good theme park shows out there for you to watch and we're here to count down the best ones for you to watch. Yeah, most of them are from Disney, but there are Non-Disney Shows on this list. =)

While some coasters are rightly praised such as Maverick and El Toro, and some coasters are rightly demoized like Dragon and Wild Beast. But then there are the underrated coasters. These coasters are either just totally forgotten about and ignored by the roller coaster community or are wrongly demonized, being considered total peices of sh*t, when they are in fact fun rides. Some of these may be amazing rides, some may not be, but all of these coasters, despite the fact that they seem like they have nothing in common, are all underrated by the coaster community. See what you've been neglecting.

While some coasters are downright amazing such as Expedition Ge Force and El Toro and always get referenced as the great "Oh, you have to ride this" type of ride. Everyone always posts their Top 10 Lists. And thats what all these lists have been. Top 10 Best. Top 10 Best Wooden Coasters, Steel Coasters, Theme Parks, Water Slides, etc. But then there are those bad rides. That ride thats so downright horrible that you get a migrane just from hearing its name, the sheer sight of it sends shivers down your spine, and you want to warn your friends to stay away, but don't want to talk about the ugly coasters, well don't worry. I'm gonna do that for you. So keep your eyes out, for these are the Top 10 Worst Coasters ever. Be sure to stay away.

They're pretty much the most popular type of flat ride in theme parks (Well, except for carousels and ferris wheels). But which ones are the best? Which rides do the best job of just dropping you?
