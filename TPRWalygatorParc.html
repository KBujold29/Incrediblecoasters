Well, the Italy portion of TPR's Mega Europe Trip has ended. Now I loved Italy and the Italy parks were all awesome. So its sad to leave. But hey. Look at the bright side. Now I get to check out all the awesome parks in Germany and France. But to say good bye to Italy, here's some photos of a beautiful Italian Town I drove by.
</center>

<center>
Yeah. I'd really like to live here.
</center>

Ok. We are now in Switzerland. Now Switzerland isn't one of the official countries of the trip. Those would be Italy, Germany, and France. But we did drive through Switzerland. Now normally just because we drive through somewhere, that means jack-sh*t. But just being in Switzerland is amazing. Just driving through it is incredible and makes me happy. I mean look at that!!! I wanna go cliff jumping into that lake SO BAD!!!!!!!

<center>
Bonus Stop at the Waterpark anyone? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mountain6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No need for any movies or TV Shows to play on the bus. Just look out the window.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="reststop.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to stop for lunch at this Rest Stop so we wouldn't starve and to just get out and enjoy Switzerland. Now for as much as I love Switzerland, theres one part I can't stand. HIGH PRICES!!!!! THIS COUNTRY IS SO FREAKING EXPENSIVE!!!!! A plate of spaghetti and a coke cost me â‚¬19!!!!!! That's the equivelant of $23.35!!!! These are prices that make Knotts Berry Farm look cheap!!!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mountain7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, the rest stop may have robbed me, but look!!! Such a beautiful view of the Alps!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="feild6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its so green over here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bridge6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can't stop taking photos of Switzerland!!! So f*cking beautiful!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="river4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Every photo I take looks like it should be on a post card.
</center>

</center>
<center>
Ok. The beautys all gone. We must be in France now. Ok, its not terrible. It sure as hell beats driving through any of the Midwest States, but come on. We were just in Switzerland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We have arrived at our hotel. And hey, it looks like a nice quaint little place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dinner6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They served us a really nice dinner which I really enjoyed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wine2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes. I really did mix Coke and Wine. And it actually tasted really good. Think of a sort of slightly bitter Coke that has a strong wine flavored aftertaste (Nice photo-bomb BTW Patrick).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cat2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Something tells me that that stray cat is carrying some sort of diseases.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="prayer.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In preperation for us riding what is claimed as one of the worst woodies in the world, Anaconda, Terrance says a prayer for us hoping that it won't murder us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="walygatorparc.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
YAY!!!! WE'RE AT A PARK!!! It's been over 24 hours, I'm starting to have withdrawls. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="walygatorparc2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Big shock. The Space Shot and the Topple Tower are both closed. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="phonebooth.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, you may hate us now for locking you in the phone booth, but you'll thank us when we all come back injured from Anaconda ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="parkinglot3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Busy day I see.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="walygatorparc3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets go head into the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="malarialake.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Eew. Another Malaria Lake.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="planecrash.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is that theming or did a plane really crash here?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for us to get some ERT on the main coaster here. Monster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monster2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Monster, which came from Expoland in Japan, is basically a Raptor clone. And Raptor is awesome, the only difference is that there are no mid course brakes here!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monster3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That makes it a really crazy ride!!! I loved it!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anaconda.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now after that, we get ERT on one of the worst coasters of all time. Anaconda.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anaconda2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Keeping my fingers crossed that it doesn't kill us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anaconda3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Somehow, I have a feeling that I'm going to be raped."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anaconda4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well the good news is that Anaconda didn't kill us. The bad news, is that Anaconda, or as I like to call it, French Grizzly is one of the most boring coasters of all time. THERE IS NOTHING TO THIS RIDE!!!!! ITS SO SLOW THAT THE CONTINENTS ARE MOVING AWAY FROM EACH OTHER AT FASTER SPEEDS THAN THIS THING!!!! So yeah. I still put it on my <a href="Top10WorstCoasters.html">Top 10 Worst Coasters List.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="familycoaster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. After Anaconda, this Wacky Worm is actually going to be thrilling.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="familycoaster2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh No!!! I just realized that this is the last Wacky Worm of the trip!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacecomet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for us to get the last credit of the park, Space Comet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacecomet2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It sucks. But at least its not Anaconda.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="terrorhouse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Terror House was not in the least way terrifying. But apparently the girls in front of us were scared, which made this a very funny experience.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tangor.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
With this closed, and the other two Topple Towers closed, this seems to be an extinct ride. While I'm not too bummed as the ride did look boring from videos, I did want to try it just because it was unique and it probably would've at least been fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture28.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's why I'm on this trip. =)
