Ok, so this is the first update since the North of the Border Trip. Anyways, we rode Tatsu immedietly so I could wash the Superman Ulteminte Flight taste out of my mouth.

I'd like to thank Superman Ultimate Flight for showing me just how great of a ride Tatsu is.

After the idiot from yesterday, I highly doubt that Ninja will be open today.

Well I'll be damned. Good for SFMM for taking care of the problem and opening the ride for others to enjoy.

No wonder that moron came in here! In General Public Speak, that sign says "Topless women with free beer and doughnuts can be found here."

Breaking News on Incrediblecoasters! We have learned that by walking while eating, we can eat lunch and walk to X2 at the same time. That's killing two birds with one stone!
</center>

</center>
<center>
Ah Damn It! X2 was down for the day!!! It was running fine yesterday, so what's the problem today?

I must be immune to Superman's roar as it doesn't bother me anymore.

Batman the Ride. I am able to ride this as I am not in La Ronde and the park isn't shutting down the line.
</center>

Up next was indeed Riddlers Revenge.

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
While Riddlers Revenge is a great stand up coaster, it definetly could use some ejector air.
</center>

<center>
You know, it's been so long since we've been up in the Sky Tower Museum, that we thought we should check it out again.
</center>

"DUDE!!! THIS THING IS BETTER THAN THE REAL COLLOSUS!!!!!!"

</center>
<center>
Is that all one ride? I can't tell.

So it's been Six Flags that's been behind the Obesity epedemic. Look at that advertising, it totally reveals who they are! Shame on you for making little brats fat!!!

</center>
<center>
Anyways, no wonder that moron was able to jump the fence. (If can call that a fence.)
</center>

<center>
  <img src="ninja21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ninja was just able to swoop down and hit him.
