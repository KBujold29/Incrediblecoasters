</center>
<center>
All right. Time for our next park, and today, we're off at Sarkanniemi.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nasinneulatower.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Sarkanniemi is a very intersting park to say the least. It's got a lot of fun rides, and other cool activities, and just has this atmosphere that most American parks don't quite have.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let's start this morning out with some ERT on Tornado.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tornado is a very interesting ride as it's one of only two Intamin Non-Launched Inverted coasters in the world, and yeah. It's a really fun ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's got a mild rattle and the inversions are fun and all, but what really makes this ride great are...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The inline twists. These things are awesome. They've got a ton of hangtime.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And I'm not even bringing up the inline twist through the station. Yes, this element exists and it is AWESOME!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kind of bummed that Intamin didn't make more rides like this as it's a really fun experience.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="halfpipeSARK.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We now move on to ERT on Half Pipe.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="halfpipeSARK2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After riding two of these things now (Should've been my third. Stupid Elitch Gardens), I can safely say that these are really fun rides.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="halfpipeSARK3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I particuarlly liked the running while riding gag that some of us came up with.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="halfpipeSARK4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Again, I really wish more Half Pipes were built considering how enjoyable these rides are.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedboat.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey look. I'm so famous that they put me in their Speed Boat ad."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trombi.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's get the low capacity Zamperla Volare out of the way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trombi2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, I've always said to be a fan of the Volares and I really enjoyed the other two I rode, so hopefully, this one will be just as good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trombi3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly, this was my least favorite of the 3 Volares I've ridden. Now don't get me wrong. It's not HORRENDOUS and I still don't think it's as bad as people claim, but this one definetly felt clunky and was easily the roughest one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="motogee.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving onto MotoGee.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="motogee2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Check me out and my motorcycle. On foreword!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="motogee3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was fun, considering how it was a Steeplechase clone, however, you know that leg sheild used to theme it to a motorcycle, yeah. Those are REALLY annoying and make the other Motorbike Coasters MUCH beter. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vauhtimato.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one last credit left to get, and then we're all good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vauhtimatoline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know all the coaster enthusiasts are at the park when the longest line is for the kiddy coaster. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vauhtimato2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cha-Ching.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vauhtimato3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey. This wasn't just any kiddy coaster. This kiddy coaster was my 400th coaster!! Pity me!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="angrybirdsland.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The kiddy credit is located in the brand new Angry Birds land, which I must admit, does look good. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="angrybirdsland2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kind of weird that they'd theme a kids area to suicide bombing birds, but hey, I have no problem with dark kids areas. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="angrybirdsland3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may not be the biggest Angry Birds fan, but it's much better than what they could've themed this area to.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="angrybirdsland4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those are some weird looking pigs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign349.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Please don't feed the terrorists. Thank you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch43.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving onto lunch, todays lunch was just pizza. Hey, I'm always down for pizza.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soda13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I have no idea what brand of sodas these were, but they're awesome. I looked up what Virvoitusjuoma was and it turns out to just be Finnish for Soft Drink. This doesn't help me at all!!! Is this just custom Sarkanniemi Soda, cause it looks like it from the Sarkanniemi logo. All I know is that I am a fan.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dolphinshow.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next,the park's Dolphin Show, which was perhaps the strangest show I've ever seen at any park. It was very Cirque due Solaeish, the relationship between the trainers and dolphins almost seemed romantic, and they performed to Elton John's version of the Circle of Life from the Lion King. Uh...weird.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dolphinshow2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba. Sithi uhm ingonyama

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nasinneulatower2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Moving up into the Nasinneula Tower.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign350.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It's a fast elevator ride to the top. Some people even complain of ears popping. I wish it was that fast.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="halfpipeSARK5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. This is exactly why we came up here. Photography shots.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I especially love these ariel shots of Tornado.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Really, the only work that Tornado needs is a visit from Rainbow Brite. And hell, that's already halfway done with it's DayGlo Trains.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WEE!!! INLINE TWIST!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="trombi4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bah, the Volare isn't THAT bad. Quit your bitching.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="angrybirdsland5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's a more complete look at the Angry Birds Land.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="turtle5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We are deeply saddened to report on the horrors of Turtle Tipping here at Sarkanemmi.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="planetarium.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to take a visit on their Planetarium 3D Simulator.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="planetarium2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And sorry, this sucks. Those with no interest in Astronomy at all fell asleep and I was just face-palming at how absurd and stupid it all was. Unless you wanna laugh at the concept of Sarkanemmi on the moon, Thumbs down.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainstorm27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and here's a quick rainstorm just to remind you that you are in Scandinavia.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="game6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The battle of man vs machine continues.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedboat2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After seeing that they had Jet Boating here, I HAD to do it!!! I don't even care that it's an upcharge!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedboat3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Last time I went Jet Boating was in 2008 in the Montreal River during the North of the Border Trip (Really wish I mentioned it in the update). So I was WAY overdue for another Jet Boating session. And yeah. Totally worth it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="speedboat4.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. That lake water suddenly doesn't look pretty when it's splashing all over you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="takeoff.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this may not be the most intense flat ride ever, but at least it was fun and unique.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love the floating faucet fountain.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tornadoSARK10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I just had to get another ride on Tornado while I was here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sarkanniemi2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We had to take shelter in the kids area and wait out the 2nd Rainstorm.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture72.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How the hell did that house not collapse from all of Fatass Stan's weight standing on top of it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="helsinki2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we made it back to our hotel in Helsinki.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="helsinki3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, the sun will still be out for another 5 hours. Let's grab dinner and head on out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pizzahut3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Quick word of caution to anyone planning on eating at Pizza Hut in Helsinki. A side of garlic bread only comes with 2 slices, which is a problem when 3 people are eating out.
