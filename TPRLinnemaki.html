</center>
<center>
All right. Sadly, the time has come. It's the last day of the trip, and as such, we're at our last park. Linnemaki. So let's just try and make this the best park day ever!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vuoristorata.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news is that park gave us LOTS of morning ERT, starting out with Vuoristorata, the park's scenic railway.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vuoristorata2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Have fun you guys!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vuoristorata4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hard to believe that on this trip, we've now ridden 3/5 of all the Scenic Railways in the world.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vuoristorata3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You better watch out here, for there's some SERIOUS ejector air on that hill right there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vuoristorata5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bah, I've been spoiled by Bakken's tunnel. This bores me now.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moving on with ERT, we now go to Ukko for some fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I already love the theme that Ukko is running with.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For those who don't know, Ukko is one of those Sky Loops. Finally, I've been wanting to ride one of these for a long time now. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
How's it going train.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a fun ride and all. It actually kind of reminded me of Full Throttle in a way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko6.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Some of you may be wondering how the hell Full Throttle and the Sky Loops are similar. Well think about it. A Sky Loop is basically just Full Throttle without the launch and some of the curves in a compact space. Let's look at the checklist. Hangtime from a super high inversion. Check. One big drop. Check. Shuttle Section. Check. Stop way up at top. Check. Twisty Spiralish Inversion. Check. It's basically Full Throttle. Hey SFMM, you could've just gotten this and kept Log Jammer as well as your stupid roller coaster record. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ukko7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love the view from the top of the lifthill of these Sky Loops.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotdogstatue2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Most original statue in the world.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ERT continues on with their spinning coaster, Salama.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was fun and all, but definetly one of the tamer spinning coasters I've ridden.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, at least it's a fun twisted mess that certainly looks nice over Helsinki.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kingi.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They even gave us ERT on their newest ride, Kingi, which is yes. A Mach Tower.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kingi2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
How the hell does Busch Gardens Williamsberg have so many problems with theirs when these Finnish parks can run their Mach Tower just fine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kirnu.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And finally, we also have ERT on Kirnu.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kirnu2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kirnu is one of the smaller original Zac Spin models, or as I like to call it, Baby Insane.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kirnu3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not be Insane, but at least it's possible to get a good flip on it unlike Green Lantern.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kirnu4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just need the Zac Spin in Spain and then I'll have the entire collection. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kirnu5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Kirnu Shadow Shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hmm, being forced to hold a monorail track with just your finger for no pay? I guess those Finnish jobs just aren't all what they've been cracked up to be."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign351.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Be on the lookout for seagulls before they take your food and sh*t on you.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilottiline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, what the hell is everyone lining up for?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilotti.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only are they lining up for this kiddy ride, but they're counting this as a credit. ARE YOU F*CKING SERIOUS!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilotti2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Look, I get the whole notion of counting pseudo-credits and double-tracked coasters as 2, but this is taking desperation to whole new levels.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilotti3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"SAD AND PATHETIC!!! ALL OF YOU!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pilotti4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nobody will be spared from my wrath of public shaming.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mustekala.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While you losers humilate yourself on the kiddy dark ride (Seriously, you might as well count Peter Pan @ Disneyland as a credit if that counts), I was out enjoying myself on this relatively fun flat ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kuuputin.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww, its a baby Chaos. It's so cute.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="linnunrata.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Space themed line. This can only mean one thing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="linnunrata2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. It's time for us to ride their Space Mtn knock off!!! And yeah, it was fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="linnunrata3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
LIGHT SPEED!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Moving onto the rest of the credits (so glad we got all the low capacity credits during ERT), we now move onto Tulireki.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tulireki is one of those Mack E-Motion Coasters, or as I like to call it, Pointless: The Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I am not a fan of this ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'd tell you guys to have fun, but this is not exactly the ride to shout that on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may not be a fan of this ride, but in a way, I'm still glad I rode it as it's the only Mack E-Motion Coaster in the world (for good reasons), so at least I rode something unique.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pikajuna.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We had to stop at the powered pseudo-credit, so that the whores who count them can get their "credit".
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pikajuna2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey, as long as you don't count that kiddy dark ride, you have some respect from me."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Salama from the powered coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vonkaputous.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one last credit for us to get. The parks water coaster. And yes, this one counts as a credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vonkaputous2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it may not be that great of a ride, but it WILL GET YOU WET!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vonkaputous3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPLOOSH!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hurjakuru.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we're already soaking wet, might as well continue the trend and take a spin on their rapids ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hurjakuru2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey look!! A chance for me to put my P2 Skills to good use. SIT DOWN!!! SIT DOWN!!! SIT DOWN!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama5.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hows it going people on Salama!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hurjakuru3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"If you think you can escape this ride without getting wet, then think again."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kieppi.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now we move onto the parks star attraction. Kieppi.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kieppi2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One of the best flat rides in the world. No joke.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikasirkus.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Knowing that Brooke was afraid of clowns, we HAD to do the clown themed dark ride just for her.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikasirkus3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just a dude picking up his balls here. Nothing to see.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikasirkus2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hows it going Brooke!!?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikasirkus4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Light the cannon and shoot these guys in the stratosphere!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="taikasirkus5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Well, we have successfully scared the sh*t out of Brooke."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue28.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Come on now. Don't be shy. Give your waitress a big old kiss."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch44.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's not the best lunch as this was just meatballs, but it was still good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kotkot.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Moving on, we head on over to Kot Kot, or as I like to call it, The Egg Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kotkot2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep, you ride in an egg and learn how to count on this ride. We really don't belong here. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kotkot3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Count the cocks!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. I like the Iphone themed to an old school tablet.
</center>

  <img src="fountain23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh, I really like the Afro Fountains and am glad that they have one at Linnemaki.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kehra.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know many friends from this trip will be happy to see that this enterprise is LGBT-Friendly.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vekkula.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. That fun house line isn't nearly as long as it looks. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture73.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you ever find yourself lost, just follow the balls and you'll be fine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vekkula2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Love these crooked rooms.

<center>
Look out for the sudden stop at the bottom of the slide. >=)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="panorama.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I had been told by many employees that on a clear day, you could see Estonia from the top of their observation tower. All right, let's test that theory.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="helsinki4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm, I see Helsinki and the Baltic Sea. But nope. No Estonia. Bummer. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="salama6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This should give you a good idea on how twisted the Salama layout is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tulireki6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey people down there. Can you feel the tilt on the E-Motion Coaster or is it still pointless?
</center>

I really enjoyed the 3D Show of the Wile E Coyote Cartoon. Cause hey, the Loony Tunes are awesome.

It was a very good dinner as we said good bye to everyone on the trip until next time.

</center>
<center>
All right. The trip is technically over and there are no more parks to visit. However, I went out with a small group of friends to go sight seeing that night in Helsinki and check out the touristy stuff and satisfy the travel bug in me and tell everyone that I've really been to Helsinki.

Yep, we made it back to the port we pulled in for the Overnight Ferry with the Ferris Wheel.

Aww. I like those turtle curbs. Lets import these back to America.

Helsinki is a very interesting city. I know I've always said Scandinavia as a synonym for the Nordic Countries because...come on. It's much cooler to say "I'm going to Scandinavia this summer." instead of "I'm going to the Nordic Countries this summer." But after visiting Copenhagen and Helsinki in the same month, you can REALLY tell that Helsinki is NOT a Scandinavian city. I like Helsinki alot, but it does NOT have the same vibe that I got from all the Scandinavian cities.

Fun fact. This is actually a cemetary (hard to tell from the photo) and people are out drinking, partying, and BBQing, just ignoring all the tombstones. Awesome. =)

And that's it folks. The Scandinavia Trip is now over and I flew back to Los Angeles the next day. I just want to thank Robb & Elissa for organizing yet another amazing trip, all the parks for treating us so wonderfully, and all the people on the trip for being such kick-ass people. It was definetly one of the best trips I've done and I'll always remember fondly of this trip.
