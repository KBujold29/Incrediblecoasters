We're here at Elitch Gardens. Today, we're here to review Twister II. Now at the original Elitch Gardens, there was a wooden coaster called Mr. Twister, and apparently, it was really good. But when Elitch Gardens moved across Denver, they couldn't move Mr. Twister, so it got bulldozed and a near-clone was built in its place, Mr. Twister, only it was supposed to be better and upgraded. I'm not sure if they f*cked up, or if the original Mr. Twister just wasn't that good, cause this ride is fairly mediocre. Sorry fans of Elitch Gardens, it is. All right. Let's ride. We make it to the station, pull down the lap bar, buckle the seatbelt, and we're off!!! We start off with some straight track around a fence, head around a slow turn, and then we start to climb the lifthill. We get a decent view of Elitch Gardens and Denver, and BAM!! We're at the top. We go around this S Curve, continue on with the nice view, turn around, and head down the first drop. It's fairly fun, but not as big as I was expecting. We then rise up, go through a slight turn, get some laterals, but sadly, no airtime. We then head around another turn, get a good view of some train tracks in Denver, and then head down another big drop. Wee. Oh WHAT THE--TRIMS!!!? F*CK!!!! *Sigh* Yes folks. Twister II is trimmed, and it's trimmed badly. <a href="RagingBullPhotos.html">Raging Bull</a> badly. And that REALLY dampers the ride. We then head into a double up. Not only is there no airtime here, but we actually crawl at the top. It almost feels like this coaster is going to roll back at this point in the ride. Oh, and we also curve here. We then head down another curved drop, which just gives us the sensation of movement. Cause this isn't thrilling at all. We then rise up a big curved hill, getting a nice view of those train tracks, before twisting back to the ground. We then head into a curved hill, which may not be that forceful, but it's a little fun. I guess. We then head up another flavorless curved hill, before heading into the big helix of the ride, or the sort of and then head into the big curving helix of sorts. It looks pretty, but doesn't really do much. Maybe if it wasn't for those trims, it'd be better. We get some headchoppers, curve up, lose all our speed, head into a tiny dip down and dip back up into another trim (REALLY!!?), before heading down into a curved drop underneath all the wood where we then get to TAKE THE TUNNEL!!! The tunnel isn't that exciting, but it's always fun to shout that whenever going into a tunnel. We then rise up into another hill, still in the big twisted wooden mess, with headchoppers galore. We then head into some sort of downward helix sort of part of the ride. We then dip down and head straight into the brake run. OK, I know one big problem with the ride. THOSE TRIMS!!! GOD, they're so damn harsh. But even without those trims, it just seemed...not that good. Nothing really wrong with it aside from those trims. But it did have some bumps to it. I'm not sure if this is how the original Mr. Twister was. All I know is that there's another ride similar to it, <a href="TwisterPhotos.html">Twister @ Knoebels</a>, which is a MUCH better ride, and is very similar. In fact, Twister is what Twister II SHOULD be like. And this was the actual replacement for Mr. Twister. Hopefully I caught it on a bad day and those trims will be off and it'll be a much better ride, because it just did not seem that well. It was just so dull when I rode. So yeah. Not really recommended, but at least it's a unique ride at Elitch Gardens.
