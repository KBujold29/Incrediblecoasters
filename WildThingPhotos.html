Today at Incrediblecoasters, we're going to be reviewing Wild Thing at Valleyfair. After getting in the cars and pulling down the lap bar, you go out of the station. You roll down a small dip and head up the lifthill. About a minute later, we're still climbing the lifthill. Not much is going on. Just climbing this lifthill. To your left, you get a pretty good view of Valleyfair. To your right however, not much of a view. However, that really doesn't matter, as by this point, we've finally reached the top of the lifthill. At this point, everything at Valleyfair looks really tiny as you dominate above everything else, just wanting to drop already. We fall down the first drop. While it's not an amazing first drop or anything, we do gain quite a lot of speed, so it at least does its job. We then fly up the second hill. While not as big as the first drop, this hill is still bigger than most coasters 1st drop. While it's not an amazing hill or anything, it does have a little bit of floater air to it, so that makes it fun. We then rise up another big hill. But then, we just go through a little straight track before going down a spiral drop. There aren't any laterals, but its still a fun drop, giving us some decent speed. We then rise up another spiral hill. There aren't any laterals here, we just sort of rise up and turn. We then appear to go through what appears to be some straight track, but we start to notice that we're closer to the ground. Yeah. It's really just a really not-steep drop. It's like a 5 degree angle. We then go through another low to the ground turn. Yeah. No big laterals here, but hey. We're having a good time. That's whats really important. After that, we go through some straight tra...Or up a really not-steep hill before turning into the mid-course brakes. We then drop off the mid course brakes, though we're not going too fast now. We then rise up into a bunny hop. It's not a fantastic ejector air bunny hop, but it does provide us with some mild floater air. So it's still fun. After that, it's a pretty typical and predictable ending. Bunny hop. Mild Floater Air. Whee! I guess, now we get to TAKE THE TUNNEL!!!!!!! And we get to do it again in the tunnel. Bunny Hop. Mild Floater Air. Wee I guess. Come right out of the tunnel. Bunny Hop. Mild Floater Air. Another little bump up to give another pop of floater air. Wee I guess. Turn. Some mild laterals. Brake run. Yeah. That's pretty much Wild Thing. While it's far from a bad ride, it's just nothing special. Nothing more than your typical Morgan Hyper. It's fun and all. I do enjoy the speed and the mild floater air moments. But it's really no different from its sister rides, <a href="SteelForcePhotos.html">Steel Force</a> and <a href="MambaPhotos.html">Mamba</a>. And none of them stand out in the world of hyper coasters. However, it is a fun ride. I'd definetly give it a ride when at Valleyfair.
