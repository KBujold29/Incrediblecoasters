We're here at Rainbow Magicland, where we'll be reviewing Cagliostro. The park's spinning coaster as well as their indoor coaster. All right. That's enough talking. Let's get riding. We get in the cars, pull down the lap bar, and off we go. We climb up a small lifthill, and we're off. At first, its just a couple of turns. And yeah. There's some spinning. Actually, this is the one outdoor portion of the ride. The turn where we go outside, wave to all the people in line, before heading back down inside. Now once indoors, I know the layout of the ride (sort of) since I was able to get a lights on ride and took a lights on POV. And yeah. You drop down and go through one of those typical vertical turnarounds that are common on Maurer Söhne Spinners. It's fun, particuarly since you shouldn't really know what it is since you're in the dark. And after that, you sort of meander and spin in the dark before going through a set of mid course brakes. It spins and meanders some more until you go through this helix towards the ground. It's fun. You spin some. And then you meander some more while spinning, or rather, while rotating. And that just leads us to the brake run. We climb up a lifthill to get to the top, Ninja style. And that's Cagliostro. While I will admit. It is kind of fun and I like all the indoor stuff (it has air conditioning. That's reason enough to ride), the layout itself is pretty bland and I know the spinning varies from person to person, but I just could not get it to spin. AT ALL. I'd still give it a whirl if the line is short. Who knows. Maybe you'll get a good ride. And if not, at least you have that air conditioning.
