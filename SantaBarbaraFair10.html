Ok. So this year, I will not be going to the Ventura County Fair because it collides with my big trip this summer. So to get my fair fix, Cody and I headed on up to the Santa Barbara Fair to check it out. We're very glad we did as we got to do something we wanted to do for a very long time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That's right. Get some more rides on Pole Position.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. That last statement was bullsh*t. What we were really looking foreward to was the Zipper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="footloose.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, Zipper was down and so we decided to try out Footloose.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="footloose2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude! Footloose was awesome!! It was one of the feet dangling models like the ones they have at Six Flags Discovory Kingdom and Kennywood. Which is awesome and much better than Kamakazie.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stargate3000F.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Starship 3000 was actually a lot better here than it was at the Ventura County Fair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Zipper is open!!! Marathon time!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride kicks ass on so many different levels.
</center>

<p>

<center>
No caption is needed.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chairswings5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. So aside from the Amazing Zipper and the cool Footloose, the Santa Barbara Fair has some pretty standard rides. Like these Chairswings.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chairswings6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yawn. Can we go back on the Zipper?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition28.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of yawn, look what we're about to ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*Ugh* Such valuable Zipper time being wasted on Pole Position.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cody, I don't think we're in Ventura anymore.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HOLY SH*T!!! POLE POSITION WAS RUNNING FREAKING AMAZING TODAY!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now if you remember <a href="VenturaCountyFair09.html">our last ride on Pole Position</a>, you'll hear us talk about the ride being much better than normal. The whole ride was trimless.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Even this drop was trimless!! It was really crazy!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="poleposition27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While Trimless Crazy Pole Position was fun and all, it's Tony Hawk next week that I'm really looking foreward to.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mirror3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
FYI, this is just an ordinary mirror. There is nothing fun houseish about it at all.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheel9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, Cody was still feeling tired from our Zipper Marathon and needed some more boring rides to wake him up. So we went on the Ferris Wheel. (And yes, it's bigger than the Ventura Wheel.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheel10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There's what the Santa Barbara Fair looks like.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bumpercars2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey SFMM! I can legally bump people on these Bumper Cars. Maybe you should learn something about operating Bumper Cars from the Santa Barbara Fair. ;)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="windsurfSBF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like Windsurf came up from Ventura to give us a little visit in Santa Barbara.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="windsurfSBF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nope. This is a completely different Windsurf.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="windsurfSBF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This Windsurf is like flyers. Only you can't snap them. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="snowcone2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh. I can make a better snow cone with materials from Smart & Final.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn!! Right when Cody wakes up, the Zipper breaks down!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinoutSBF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We tried to take a ride on Spin Out, but half way through the ride, it broke down on us. (Damn fair rides breaking.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The good news is that Zipper has now reopened.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Butler Amusements!! The Ventura County Fair needs their Zipper back. So for 2011, please bring the Zipper back to the Ventura County Fair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Zipper Goodness.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="avatarSBF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you thought Avatar the movie had special effects, you'll be blown away by Avatar the dark ride at the Santa Barbara Fair. This ride makes the movie look like sh*t. It ranks up with Zombie as one of the greatest dark rides in the history of dark rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scramblerSBF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is a scrambler. We rode it. We had fun. What more do you need to know?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireball.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up nest, we checked out Fireball.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireball2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was basically just Xtreme under a different name.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fireball3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And just like Xtreme, Fireball is a great Frisbee.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinoutSBF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Afterwards, we decided to take another ride on Spin Out since it broke on us last time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spinoutSBF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Insert random caption about Spin Out being upsidedown.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfasylum.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We went and saw Surf Asylum because they are a good band.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="baconhotdog.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Tonight's fair food will consist of a Bacon Hot Dog, which was actually quite good.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hardrock8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is the best ride to eat after eating a Bacon Hot Dogs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hardrock9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hard Rock was running quite well today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ferriswheel11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The Santa Barbara Fair had great lights. Their Ferris Wheel light up like the Mickey Wheel!! Why can't your ferris wheel do that Ventura County Fair?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="zipper10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And how else do you end a day like this other than marathoning the best flat ride ever.
