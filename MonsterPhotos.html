We're here at Walygator Parc to ride Monster. A <a href="RaptorPhotos.html">Raptor</a> Clone and not only the best coaster at Walygator Parc BY FAR, but also the best roller coaster in all of France. Anyway, after pulling down the shoulder harness, the floor drops and away we go. We head into a small dip out of the station and head straight for the lifthill. Up the lifthill we climb. Higher and higher we go. Once we get to the top, we get a lovely view of rural France and farmland. How riveting. However, you have to enjoy the view while it lasts, because as soon as it's over, we are whisked to the left and start to roar down the first drop. Up next would be the vertical loop. We shred through the loop as if it were an invitation to go listen to Rush Limbaugh. After that powerful loop, the surge into the best part of the ride. The Zero G Roll. We get WHIPPED through it before we can even blink. By this point, a smile is glued to our face and we feel as if we are on happy pills. We then roar up into the cobra roll. After rising up like a vertical loop, we get snapped to the right before doing it again. After some sort of useless Inverted trick track, we viciously roar into an upward helix and into the mid course brakes. Here's the one advantage that Monster has over Raptor. I know I said that on Raptor, the mid course brakes aren't that strong. But on Monster, they don't even exist!! It's just straight track into a nice swooping drop. Oh, I love that. I just love that. We gain quite a bit of speed from that swooping drop before surging into the first corkscew. We are whipped through the corkscew with alot of force.  We then fly through some straight track before making a quick turn and a quick dip before roaring into Corkscrew #2. This corkscrew is even more powerful than the first one and that first corkscrew was pretty damn powerful. Afterwards, we surge on into one of the most powerful fake helixes of death. Our asses are glued to the seat as we spiral towards the sky. We then go through one final turn, before hitting the brake run. And another plus for most enthusiasts is that there's no Raptor Smack here. I personally don't mind the Raptor Smack, but it doesn't really matter as this coaster is awesome either way. I'd highly recommend riding Monster if at Walygator Parc. It is a fantastic B&M Inverted Coaster that is definetly worth some rides. Not to mention, it's the only stand out ride at the park and is almost certainly the only reason you came here.
