All right. Time for another New Years Eve, and this year, we decided to do something different and spend New Years Eve at Knotts Berry Farm. Yeah, now we've spent New Years Eve at every single park in Southern California. We've spent it at <a href="SFMMsRockNRideNewYearsEveParty09.html">Six Flags Magic Mountain.</a> We've spent it at the <a href="IncrediblecoastersChristmasNewYears20112012DLR.html">Disneyland Resort.</a> And now we're spending it at Knotts Berry Farm. And of course, we're starting it out at Fuddruckers. Why? Because BUFALLO BURGERS!!!

<center>
Oh my. That has got to be the most flamboyant limousine I have ever seen. Please tell me that Prince or Elton John is at the park today. 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
All right. Lets start out our day on Knotts Berry Farm's star attraction, Xcelerator.

Merry Christmas from Knotts Berry Farm! After all, the holiday is only 358 days away!!! =)
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
I see Knotts Berry Farm has been taking marketing lessons from Full Throttle. 
</center>

<p>

<img src="coastrider8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELL NO!! WE ARE NOT RIDING COAST RIDER TODAY!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogride26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry. We got plenty of rides on Timber Mtn Log Rides, with lots of oppertunities for them to yell "SIT DOWN!!!".
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="calicomineride11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That would be a pretty wreath on Calico Mine Ride. Except its not Christmas Time anymore.
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
The vultures have arrived to scavenge and eat all the dead ornaments that should be putten away right now. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostriderline6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Knotts Berry Farm is EXTREMELY crowded today. I really prefer it in when we went on <a href="IncrediblecoastersChristmasNewYears20112012KBF.html">New Years Day</a>. Nobody comes then cause they're all too busy being hungover.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevenge28.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Oh hey. Montezooma's Revenge is open today! So at least we got some nice Schwarzkoph goodness in today. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="knottsberryfarm15.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Insert "It's not Christmas Time anymore" caption here.
</center>

<p>

<img src="larevolution6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ohh. A frisbee without any restraints. That oughta make it better. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="boomerang21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We rode both the Boomerang and the flyers today. The flyers because their awesome. The Boomerang because...it had a short line. Ok! Plus, at least I didn't marathon it 6 times like <a href="SixFlagsDiscovoryKingdom2014.html">Cody did with Kong.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="gunshop3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know what. I suddenly decided I want to carry around a deadly weapon wherever I go. Where can I aquire such a thing?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="money3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"MONEY!!! I'VE BEEN KILLING MYSELF FOR THIS FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS!! I NEED IT!!! GIMME!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign372.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Maybe now with all that money, I can actually afford a college education where I will learn to properly spell "Millionaire". <a href="http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/2014/10/03/german-colleges--free-degrees--americans/16658027/">Or I can just go to Germany.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bullet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Which bullet do I want to kill you with?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="checkers.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, this is a fun way to kill the time since all the lines are too damn long. We even had a random girl specate our checkers game.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xceleratorline3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
HELL NO!! NOT WORTH IT!!
</center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
After a great dinner at Mrs. Knotts, we came back into the park for more fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign373.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may hate Christmas stuff after Christmas, but New Years Eve is a holiday. So this is acceptable until January 2nd.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider35.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ghostrider was running GREAT tonight!! Yes, it was rough, but it was good rough. Like Rough Sex.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="knottsberryfarm17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. That's just awesome. I love it. Even if its out of place.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="museum.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. Knotts Berry Farm actually has a museum. Yay! Another new thing for me to discover!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="museum2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ohh. Impressive.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign374.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well you certainly had a lot of time on your hands.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skytowerKBF.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah yeah. It's soon going to be 2015. I know.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds63.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thank you for sucking all the people away from the rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator65.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See. Now we got an Xcelerator ride. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevengeline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And just look how long the line for Montezooma's Revenge is.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
Windseeker's grave has been reduced to a Hat and Blow Horn dispensary for New Years Eve.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="newyears4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
New Years Eve. An excuse for me to wear a hat, blow a horn, drink alcohol (the years when I'm not at a theme park event), and be an obnoxious ass for a night.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogrideline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You suckers can all be crowded by the stage. We're gonna watch the fireworks from the Timber Mtn Log Ride line and ride it when its 2015.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skytowerKBF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, speaking of 2015, it's here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This happens all the time actually. We just call it midnight. That's all.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WE'VE GONE AROUND THE SUN!! YAY!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But seriously. This was a great New Years event that Knotts pulled off, and 2015 certainly has some exciting things to look foreword to (JAPAN!!!).
