We're here at Heide Park to ride Grottenblitz. You get in the cars and off you go. We go around a turn slowly, head around another turn, slowly accellerating. It's not that fast, but we're getting a nice view of all the theming as Grottenblitz is a very well themed powered coaster. We then head uphill a little bit and accelerate. Remember, it's a powered coaster. IT DOESN'T COUNT AS A CREDIT!!! We then head into the building and go around this forest theming. It's actually really well done as we accelerate through the trees and head through this downward helix around the plastic tree. We then head up and decelerate as we head outside. We head around this turn that's actually on this bridge, adding to the beautiful theming this ride has. And we go through the station and go through the whole thing again. It's actually a really fun ride and even amongst all the well themed European Powered Coasters, Grottenblitz is still one of the better ones. I'd definetly say it's worth a ride when visiting Heide Park, even if it won't increase your credit count at all.
