<center>
Well after afun morning at Walygator, we went over to Germany so we could check out Holiday Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. The park really looks nice. I see Plopsa made some nice changes to the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="holidaypark2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well there's only one main reason we decided to come to Holiday Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="holidaypark3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep!!! To check out their mascot Holly the Parrot!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign239.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Actually what we really came for is just over here.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We came to ride Expedition G Force.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforceline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I know we have ERT on it later tonight, but we're gonna still wait in the 20 minute line for it now. Mostly for two reasons. 1: I'm antsy since I've been f*cking wanting to ride this coaster for years and after years and years of waiting, I'm not going to wait a couple more hours. And 2: I'm getting an insurance ride in incase the ride decides to blow up and ERT has to be cancelled. But hey. That's a very unlikely scenario. But with a ride this good, you don't want to risk it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="americanflag.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The park must have known we were coming today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Its time to ride this thing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. That is one of the best first drops ever. An insane assload of laterals and ejector air!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And hey. After that insanity just comes some really long goes on forever floater air.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce5.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But don't you worry about the lack of laterals. We've got that covered on this ride as well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce6.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These overbanks are very much like the one on Bizarro @ Six Flags New England where the curves are also really tight and have a whip to them and aren't just fun cruiser elements like on Xcelerator and Millenium Force.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce7.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. So now the question is where did it land on my Top 10 Steel Coasters List? Well, honestly, I'd say I give it the #1 spot. Though really, at this point, its kind of pointless since everythings so good and close together that I feel like I'm picking a name out of a hat, but hey. It really is one of the best coasters I've been on. Can't wait for tonights ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce8.JPG" width="640" height="511" />
</center>
<center>
What is up with the girl in white?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgfalkenstein.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. Lets go check out the rest of the park starting with their dark ride. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgfalkenstein2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, so I'm not exactly sure what this dark ride is about. I just see these two together.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgfalkenstein3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OH NO!!!! BOOBS!!!! PROTECT THE CHILDREN FROM THE HORRORS!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="superwirbel.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets just focus on getting the other two credits here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="superwirbel2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. After Expedition Ge Force, this is what we have to suffer through.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="superwirbel3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though to be fair to the ride, this was by far the best Vekoma Corkscrew that I had been on. It was fast and not that rough. I had fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hollyswildeautofahrt.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now we just need to focus on the other credit. Hollys Wilde Auto-Fahrt.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hollyswildeautofahrt2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Its just another Wild Mouse. Nothing special.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hollyswildeautofahrt3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Much like the Corkscrew, this thing was running great. It was completely trimless and running like a bat out of hell.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lighthousetower.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! The Starflyer here actually has some height to it!!! It actually feels intense!!!! I loved it!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="teufelsfasser.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've heard good things about this log flume.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="teufelsfasser2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah. Its got a nice theme, a fun little backwards section, and a cool double drop. Yeah, this is a good one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgshanke.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok,lets get some dinner in before we head over for our ERT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mezzomix.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! Club Cool was right!!! They really do have Mezzo Mix in Germany!!! Funny how I never saw a single Beverly in all of Italy, and now I constantly see Mezzo Mix in Germany. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="burgshanke2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. The Schnitzel they have in this park is just fantastic. Yeah, Great Schnitzel, Fries, and High Quality German Beer sounds like a good dinner to me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh no. It didn't happen.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SH*T!!!!! EXPEDITION GE FORCE BROKE DOWN RIGHT BEFORE OUR ERT!!!! AND IT BROKE DOWN GOOD!!!!!! =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anubisfreefall.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But they opened up the Drop Tower for us while they tried fixing Expedition G Force. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anubisfreefall2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a good drop tower, but from what I've been told, it was rethemed to some random British Kids Show. I have no idea what its about, but I already hate it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="anubisfreefall3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There. That makes the show much better.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While the parks maintenence crew was doing their damn best job to fix the ride for us, the park treated us to complementary ice cream and muffins.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey, I may have missed Expedition Ge Force since I was too busy drinking beer, but look at this way. Now I can drink even more beer!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"DAMN YOU INTAMIN GODS!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforceline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Everyones lined up. This should be good. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OOH!!! THEY MADE PROGRESS!!! WE JUST MIGHT GET OUR ERT AFTER ALL!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="expeditiongeforce14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After a couple test runs, it broke down again and it would take even more time, so yeah. We couldn't wait any more and had to just leave. Yeah, it sucks. But hey, thats just life. Nasty Sh*t happens. And I want to thank Holiday Park for providing the ice cream, beer, and muffins and for doing their damn best they could to get it fixed. They easily could've just said "Yeah. It broke. Sorry. Sh*t out of luck. Bye." But they did their absolute best to try and get our ERT going again. Well I'll definetly be back to get some more Expedition Ge Force rides since it is one of my favorite coasters ever and this park is just awesome in general.
