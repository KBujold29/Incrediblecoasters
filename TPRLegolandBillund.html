All right. Onto our next park, and of course, along the way, we were greeted to the entertainment from Ross, who made this the funniest and filthiest bus ever on a trip. Why? Well...let's just say that there's a reason I called it the C*nt Bus and leave it at that. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="legolandbillund.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep, we're at Legoland Billund today. After really enjoying the <a href="LegolandCA2012.html">Legoland California</a>, I was looking foreword to visiting Legoland Billund in Denmark.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Excuse me, but I'm looking for the out-of-town weirdos. They're the ones who aren't made of legos."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Joe is so desperate that he's stooped down to the level of Lego Clowns for some love.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Never thought I'd be seeing any statues not made from legos today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="presentation9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Now I know that Legoland Billund is intended for a younger audience, but I know deep inside, you're all the right demographic for this park."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego5.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!! Pretty!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we had to start out with ERT on their star attraction. Polar X-Plorer.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
EXCITEMENT EVERYONE!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign332.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww, looks like Polar X-Plorer is not a POV-Friendly coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While that may be true during normal park operating hours, it was POV-Friendly during ERT. I love the flexibility in Europe and not the hardass rules in America where they never make exceptions and there is no way in hell you will ever get a POV. Love that they change the rules based on who the clientelle is. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But enough about that. How was Polar X-Plorer as a coaster?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, this ride kicked ass!! Not in the typical insanely intense way, but this is easily one of the best family coasters ever built.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's just a really fun, enjoyable, re-rideable coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I knew about this surprise before I rode it, but just in case you want to be surprised, just be known that something cool happens here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After the fun roller coaster section, it just cruises through an outdoor dark ride section where you see lego animals.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarxplorer9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Drop the lego bacon. The lego wolves are onto us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"We made it to the North Pole!!!" (Hey, it's not THAT far from here).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Parents in America would not be happy about this dudes ass hanging out around the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthauntedhouse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now let's get first rides on Legoland's newest ride. Ghost.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Having kids play with legos while waiting in line = Genius Idea.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Ahh!!! Lego Frankenstein!!! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzhGIOeAciE">Burn it with fire!!!</a>"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Disney does not approve of the magic lego lamp.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghosthauntedhouse2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After going through a really cool mirror maze, you ride the ride, which is an interestingly themed drop tower/frog hopper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeracers.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Moving on with the credits, now we're onto Xtreme Racers.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeracers2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's basically the same big Wild Mouse they have at all the other Legoland Parks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xtremeracers3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not sure what it is about these rides that are just a ton of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Now we're onto the Dragon.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Looking for me?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Legoland Billund seems to be infested with lego reptiles today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
FALL!!! FALL!!! FALL!!!
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunetly, the Dragon here is powered. So this one doesn't count as a credit. =(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="dragonLB5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, it still works well for the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="temple.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to check out their Shooting Dark Ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="temple2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was really good and all, I just wish that I didn't suck so bad at these things.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepilots.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now let's move onto their real star attraction (You were thinking it was Polar X-plorer? That's cute).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepilots2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just like the Robot Arm at Legoland CA, you can choose the intensity between Levels 1-5.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepilots3.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
But not only that, but this one lets you freaking control just how it's gonna flip (with limitations). If it wasn't for said limitations, I'd make this thing go so crazy that the other people on this tour would be puking all over the exits. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepilots4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, it's still an amazing flat ride and I still managed to design it so we flipped a LOT.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icepilots5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We need more Robot Arms in this world.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="familybuffet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for our group lunch at the Family Buffet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lego dude on the Saxaphone > Most popular musicians today.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch34.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While visually impressive with lego fries, the meal here was not one of the better ones of the trip.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icecream11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But hey. At least I get to have all this ice cream.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, you can't have a Legoland without a Miniland. So let's go and check that out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. You can tell that this is the European Miniland.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
See what can be accomplished when lobbyists aren't running the country America? =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I may not be able to point out famous places here (I'm sorry for being a crappy Dane), but I still really like all the lego recreations
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just another typical day in Danish Legoland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I can safely say that that's pretty Danish right there.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry. I don't have much else to say other than it's pretty and I like it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB8.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, we've moved on from Denmark and into Chinatown.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lego Hollywood, much like real Hollywood, is full of sh*t.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Lego version of a famous Copenhagen sight I just recently saw.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="legomonorail.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Let's hop on the Lego Monrail for an ariel view of Miniland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Look at the pretty castle.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, they had to add in Miniland Star Wars.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, they do in fact, play the classic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qd198SFwo">Cantina Band Song</a> here. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nintendo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just in case you ever get bored, feel free to play some Nintendo.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
More little touches you can find in any Legoland Park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lego13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Fun fact. Is the American Tourist in front of the camera or behind it?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="miniboats.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hows it going!! We're on a boat!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateboats.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now that lethal injection drugs are harder to find, folks are moving back to more (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTmd2f8zZQY">visibly</a>) barbaric methods of execution, including being fed to crocodiles. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateboats3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. Legoland Billund has their very own knock off of Pirates of the Carribean.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateboats2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
♫ Yo-Ho Yo-Ho. A lego's lifes for me. ♫
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pirateboats4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you need someone to yell at your clientele to "SIT DOWN!!!!", I'm your man.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="firebrigade.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
A common staple at the Legolands is the Fire Academy rides, but for some reason, I didn't do it at Legoland California, so this was my first one.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="firebrigade2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Needless to say, I sucked. Sorry everyone who hates me for making them lose.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vikingsriversplash.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Another one of the really cool attractions that they have at Legoland Billund is their rapids ride with the elevator lift.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="vikingsriversplash2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, it is awesome, and yes. It does get you wet (as demonstrated by Caesar).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="minilandLB14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Looks like George Washington has finally gotten the Q-Tip <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/miniland8.JPG">out of his ear.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bread2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on everyone!! Let's gather round the open flame!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bread3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Best food we will be eating on the entire trip. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>

"Please put your camera away when our fish get drunk. Thank you."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sealife.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Best part of the Sea-Life Aquarium here? It's free with admission. SWEET!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sealife2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Oh dear. It looks like we've got a severe case of Decompression Sickness here."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="jungleracer.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Sweet!!! They also have a Water Whip here. Love those things."
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterfountain6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I FOUND A WATER FOUNTAIN!!! No seriously, this is the first water fountain I saw on the entire trip!!! I really stand by my previous statements about Europe needing more water fountains. And that was Southern Europe where they may not have been as commonplace as in the U.S, but at least they existed!!! Here in Northern Europe, they're DAMN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE to find. Thank god it's not nearly as hot here as it was in Italy or else we would've had some problems.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="blockbuster.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

"There's a Blockbuster...and it's open for buisness? IT WORKED!!! MY TIME MACHINE OFFICIALLY WORKS!!!!" =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mcdonalds7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yeah, it's just another quiet night in Aarhus for us. Nothing special, just McDonalds.
