OK. We had some fun at some smaller new for me parks. But it's time to get back to the hardcore stuff. The big parks. And oh boy, we've got a lot to cover today.

I know most parks will have some tram from the parking lot to the entrance. But the Hersheypark ones look pretty vintage and nice.

You know, I've seen those Colliders at the grocery store repeatedly. But I've never thought about getting one since....I'm on a budget. And when I splurge, I just go for regular ice cream. But I'm curious. Gonna try these next grocery run.

I know it's technically not part of the park. But it's still a lot of fun and something that I really enjoy. Plus, there's a dark ride in here!

Unfortunately, you won't get a chance to see what sort of unholy abomination of a candy bar I would've created. At least not today. Perhaps on a future visit with more money.

 <p>

<img src="chocolatetour5.JPG" width="640" height="480">

OK. What the hell is up with these anthropomorphic candy mascots? They're really creepy looking. Do they enjoy being eaten? Do they know that they're food? Would eating these be vegetarian? I'd say if they're vegan, but they're already not in reality due to ðŸŽµthe milk chocolate (Now the song is stuck in my head)ðŸŽµ. So does that mean that these anthropomorphic candy bars are genetically related to cows due to ðŸŽµHershey's Milk Chocolate?ðŸŽµ Would they be welcome at a cow family reunion? If not, is it due to their candy status, or did they just piss off the rest of the cows? Do cows discriminate against candy people? Are the wrappers their clothes or part of their body? If so, does that mean that the Hershey's Kiss is wearing the candy equivelant of a burqa?

 <p>
<center>
<img src="chocolatetour8.jpg" width="640" height="480">

<center>
Speaking of ðŸŽµIt's the Milk ChocolateðŸŽµ, they upgraded the cows and replaced the song. WHAT!!? NO!!! BOO!!! I don't care about the rest of the upgrades. If anything, it's an improvement. But those singing cows KICKED ASS!! AND GOD DAMN IT!!! THEIR MILK CHOCOLATE SONG GOT <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6sXke5e1_M">STUCK IN YOUR HEAD</a>!!! AND IT WAS FUN!!! THE NEW SONG SUCKS!!! BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL COWS WITH THE ORIGINAL SONG!!!

You know, a couple years since my Japan Trip, I've noticed that Wacky Kit-Kat flavors have begun to cross over. Granted, they don't have all the same flavors I saw <a href="Japan18Toshimaen.html">in Japan</a> (Please bring the Kyoto Grape Kit-Kat to America). But I've definately seen some wacky flavors, such as <a href="IMG_4293.jpeg">Blueberry Muffin</a> (It was good. But I honestly prefered all the ones I tried in Japan. Just not a huge blueberry fan), Dark Chocolate, Mint, and Mocha (those three are barely even wacky). And though I didn't try it, Key-Lime Pie Kit-Kat sounds great! I love the Wacky Kit-Kat trend. Keep them coming. =)

I know I'm on a budget and spent more than expected today on fastpass (explination later), but I WANT THAT DAMN IT!!!

<center>
So this was one of the first out-of-state parks I ever <a href="ThrillCoastersHersheypark.html">visited</a>, back when it was 2007 and I was 15. But despite being one of the first non-CA parks I did, I hadn't returned after my initial first visit. It took me 14 years (Nearly the same time I was when I first visited) until I came back. And.....Hersheypark has added A LOT since my last visit (let alone the stuff that was there, but I just didn't bother with). I was GREATLY overdue to go back here. So this semi-feels like a new park with all the new stuff, but not really since....I still remember this place.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
OK. First things first, time for their new (for last year) coaster. This things gonna get swarmed, so we should knock it out.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymoniumline.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! I KNEW IT WAS GONNA GET SWARMED!!! BUT I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE THIS F*CKING BAD!!!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Candymonium is a brand new B&M Hyper. They're fun. But I'm not exactly the biggest B&M Hyper Fan and didn't exactly have high hopes for this ride. But hey. Orion greatly exceeded my expectations. Maybe Candymonium will do the same and this'll be on par with rides like Nitro & Diamondback.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium3.JPG" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
Unfortunately, nope. This was just like what I was expecting. If anything, this was even weaker than I expected.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I will give it this. It has a really fun first drop. I mean, it's a hyper coaster. They ALL have a good first drop. It's kind of required on a hyper coaster lol. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium5.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
But yeah. Out of all the B&M Hypers we rode on this trip, this was BY FAR the weakest. I greatly prefered both Nitro & Diamondback to this. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium6.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Honestly, this might be a controversial opinion, but I personally found Candymonium to be the weakest full-sized B&M Hyper. Yep. Excluding Hollywood Dream (running forewards), this is my least favorite one.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium7.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Though I will give Candymonium this. It is EXTREMELY photogenic (despite being painted brown). That ending helix may not be super forceful, but it sure is gorgeous.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="candymonium8.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
OK. Time for an Incrediblecoasters Rant. The operations at Hersheypark were pretty bad today. But on Candymonium, they were BEYOND ATROCIOUS!!! THIS IS YOUR BRAND NEW (Still excluding last year, despite the fact that it was one of the few new coasters to actually in 2020, just because....as far as the theme park world is concerned, 2020 didn't exist) ROLLER COASTER!!! IT IS INSANELY POPULAR!!! IT IS AN EXTREMELY CROWDED DAY!!! AND YOU'RE NOT ONLY STACKING, BUT DOUBLE-STACKING!!!! SERIOUSLY!!! I KNOW I GAVE THE EXTERMINATOR RIDE OPS A LOT OF SH*T (And rightfully so), BUT YOU GUYS ARE JUST AS BAD!!! DO YOUR F*CKING JOB BETTER AND PUSH THOSE TRAINS OUT!!! IT'S A B&M HYPER!!! THIS RIDE SHOULD BE EATING PEOPLE AND THE LINE SHOULD BE FLOWING LIKE WATER!!! Yeah, not sure if you can tell, but AJ is literally giving a thumbs down (for the operations). I share your thumbs down.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="crowds121.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Hersheypark isn't just crowded today. *hyena laugh* Oh, god no! IT IS F*CKING NIGHTMARISHLY CROWDED!!! Seriously. I'm really getting similar vibes to my <a href="TPRParcAsterix.html">Parc Asterix</a> visit crowd-wise. It's honestly starting to rival <a href="Japan18UniversalStudiosJapan.html">Universal Studios Japan</a>. The crowds are THAT BAD today!!! *Sigh* If I was a PA local, I would just go home. I unironically have done this at both SFMM & KBF. Why the f*ck did we decide to visit on a Friday?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Candymonium may be the hot new ride at the park, but THIS is the coaster since my last visit that I was most looking foreward to. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush3.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Skyrush is one of those rides that was just hyped up to death. Even the people who hate this ride hated it in a way that intrigued me. This ride according to everyone, was essentially MADE for me. So....did it live up to my incredibly high expectations?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Technically no since....I was thinking that this might just become my new favorite coaster of all time with all the reports of airtime so strong it hurts and being afraid of it literally trying to eject you. Nah. El Toro's Rolling Thunder Hill still reigns supreme of all the airtime moments, with El Toro still being my favorite coaster.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush5.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
But with that said, this is an AMAZING ride!!! It's not only in my <a href="Top10SteelCoasters.html">Top 10 Steel Coasters</a>, it's in my Top 5 (It's just not #1). And the airtime on this thing is INSANE!!! It genuinely feels like it wants to eject you and does make you nearly grab your lap-bar in a few "OH SH*T!!!" moments. I honestly love that.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I know people bitch about these restraints. And....I can see why. These things dig into you. And....you FEEL the airtime. On the one hand, this ride IS BRUTAL on your thighs. That is true. But at the same time, it's also pretty free. It kind of makes the ride a little more terrifying having these restraints. Though....yeah. Not gonna lie. Clamshells are better restraints.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush6.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
BAM!!! EJECTOR AIR!!!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush7.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I know it may not look like the craziest ride ever. But.....DROOL!!! LOVE THIS RIDE SO F*CKING MUCH!!! This makes up for all the horrifying crowds at the park today.

If you want more of my thoughts on this amazing ride, go check out my updated <a href="OfficialHersheyparkPage.html">Hersheypark Review</a>. I just posted with this update, updated reviews of all the old coasters, and new reviews of the stuff we rode this visit, including both Skyrush, and Candymonium.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush9.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Forgot to talk about the laterals. Because Skyrush isn't JUST about the crazy ejector air. There's also some WILD laterals that'll throw you around like a rag doll. Seriously. This ride does EVERYTHING in its power to throw you off.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyrush10.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Grr. Amazing super happy mood about how much I love Skyrush just got soured by its sh*tty operations. >=(

 <p>
<center>
<img src="crowds122.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So one explenation for the monsterous crowds so above average is that all the school reading field trips that did their honor roll for 2020 were postponed (despite Hersheypark opening last year. Guess the schools wanted to play it safe since there was no vaccine last summer) and everyone just did it today. Ugh. We REALLY had bad luck at Hersheypark today.

So this ride was here last visit. But for some reason, I just didn't ride it. Why!? Why did I bother with Wild Mouse and Trailblazer, but blow off Super Dooper Looper!? WTF was I thinking!? Well, time to correct the mistake of stupid 15 year old me.

Speaking of Revolution, this ride is basically just Diet Revolution.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="superdooperlooper5.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It has all the same elements as Revolution. Big Drop, Loop, Thread the Loop, Curved Hills. But far less of them and is a lot shorter. If you love Revolution, but thought that it was too long and only wanted a highlights reel of it, then Super Dooper Looper is the ride for you.

I know I already mentioned getting fastpass, but I can NOT emphasize how useful these were today. WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! Cause I would NOT be a happy dude if they didn't sell these today.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="greatbear7.JPG" width="640" height="480">

<center>
Now I criticized this when I first rode it as one of the weaker B&M Inverts. I've ridden SO MANY more B&M Inverts since then. And....I mostly stand by everything I've said.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="greatbear8.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
My Random: The Ride remark still feels true. For instance, the helix at the beginning. That is....I'm not sure if I really like this pre-first drop helix or am annoyed by it. It feels a little awkward and a bit of a cocktease before the real meat of the ride begins. But....hey. At least it gives the ride some needed flavor and makes it stand out.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="greatbear9.JPG" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
OK. The helix beforehand does help the first drop by giving it some bonus speed before it rips down the first drop. I'll give the pre-first drop helix a thumbs up.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="greatbear10.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
The one thing that saves this from being at the bottom of my B&M Invert list is that for 1/3 of the ride, it actually is a really fun and strong B&M Invert.

The fact that there's whip in this Heartline Spin automatically means this ranks above Silver Bullet, Talon, and similar rides.

<center>
So another new ride they got is the Triple Tower. It's basically 3 S&S Towers. The Small Kiss Double Shot, the Medium Resses Space Shot, and the Big Hershey Bar Turbo Drop. I didn't do any of them simply because....the horrifying crowds pushed all thoughts of flat rides out of my mind. Plus, it seems fun. But nothing psecial. But I do admit. I love the asthetic of the 3 of them together stacked in size order.

Hey Storm Runner. Sorry to break the news, but you're no longer my favorite coaster at Hersheypark.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="stormrunner11.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
No need to worry. You're still a great ride and my 2nd favorite coaster at the park. Skyrush is just too good (better than Candymonium though). =)

I know there are other Rocket Coasters that are more than just a launch, top hat, and filler elements. But Storm Runner just curbstomps them all. Still the best of the Rocket Coasters.

Why is Storm Runner the only coaster with a Flying Snake Dive!? This inversion kicks ton of ass and the fact that NO OTHER COASTER has added this is a crying shame!

Yeah. I obviously highly recommend this ride.

You know, for some reason, Lightning Racer just isn't that popular today. Not sure why, but for as bad as the crowds are today, it seemed like Lightning Racer had a relatively short line.

I know I've ridden MANY more GCIs since my last visit here. And the ride itself is pretty meh. But honestly, the racing and dueling is what makes this ride.

Ugh. Even with fastpass, this thing STILL has a long wait. Granted, it's far better to wait 20 minutes vs 2.5 hours like everyone else. But....ugh. Still not happy about that.

Well, at least the line has a lot of wacky fun theming to distract you. And it's air conditioned too. So thanks for that Hersheypark.

So Laff Track is a basic Maurer Sohne Spinner. A clone of Steel Dragon @ Waldameer that we rode a couple days ago. Only inside and with some cool theming. The good news. I REALLY like the theming and the music. That REALLY helps. The downside is....this really didn't spin for me. It probably spun the least out of all the clones. Maybe we just had bad luck with weight distribution. I forgot how we sat. But still an overall fun ride thanks to the theming.

<center>
<img src="wildmouse3.JPG" width="640" height="480">

So I remember when I first rode this, I REALLY liked it as it was the strongest Wild Mouse I had ridden and seemed so much more agressive than Goofy's Sky School (then Mulholland Madness). But with all the crazy Wild Mice I rode in Europe, plus Lagoon's mouse...yeah. Suddenly, this seems pretty meh and average.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wildmouse4.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Still a fun ride. Just don't expect it to be particuarly brutal unless you've only been on particuarly crappy Mice.

*Sigh* We didn't forget about it. Fahrenheit has been down all day and never opened up. This is incredibly frustrating because this ride opened 1 year after my first visit, and it has been teasing me to come back to Hersheypark for the past 13 years. Then when I finally get back, "HA HA!!! F*CK YOU KEVIN!!! I'M CLOSED!!!". *Sigh* At least it was only Fahrenheit closed and not Skyrush (we were so close to missing that with the cable snapping). =(

If you really want to ride Wildcat on your next Hersheypark visit, bad news. Since my visit (Sorry the updates are <a href="TasteofBoysenberryFestival21.html">so damn late</a>), they decided that they're closing Wildcat and giving it the RMC treatment.

I'm sure some enthusiasts are mourning the loss of this historic coaster (It actually technically is as the first ever GCI).

I may not mourn the loss of this ride, I will admit that I didn't hate this ride. In fact, I kind of liked it.

<img src="wildcat8.jpg" width="640" height="480">

It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't too rough. And it had some decent forces, and even a few moments of airtime. Fun ride overall.

Yeah. I may be a big credit whore. But with crowds like THIS, I am NOT doing Cocoa Cruiser. Both because it almost certainly has a HORRENDOUS wait and isn't on fastpass, and with such horrifying crowds, there's probably some stick up their ass parent who would scowl at us for credit whoring. I'll just have to snag that credit next time (which hopefully WON'T be on a day like today).

I may have been pissed about Farenheight being closed visit. But considering how the lifthill broke about a week after we visited and the ride closed for the rest of the year, I would SO RATHER miss Fahrenheit and get to ride Skyrush than vice versa. Once again, I can NOT emphasize how much good luck we had regarding rides on this trip.
