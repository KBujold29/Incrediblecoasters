All right. Over Spring Break, I mostly just worked @ Six Flags Magic Mountain, but I did also manage to squeeze in a trip to the Disneyland Resort as well. And here to welcome our arrival is none other than the Mad Hatter himself.

<center>
Good Idea Thunder Mtn Goat. If we blow up half of the people in the park, it won't be nearly as crowded.
</center>

<p>
<center>

While Thunder Mountain wasn't quite running its best today, but hey. It was still fun, like it always is.

<center>
All this time, we've been f*cking idiots. It turns out that California Screamin has been a water coaster all this time.
</center>

<p>
<center>

We got some Dole Floats. They were good, but certainly not worth the HUGE wait.

Hey Celeste. Your trip to Africa may have been postponed, but here's the next best thing. A trip on the Jungle Cruise.
</center>

When you see a monkey with a gun, stab it with a knife.

Since this is supposed to make up for our medical mission in Sierra Leone, when can we start operating on the animals?

While I didn't get an evacuation like I did when I got stuck in the Cold Chamber on Test Track, I briefly got to ride the ride with the lights on and without any music, as demonstrated in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94JGF-QeTYU&list=UUaE-pwaJIYiDBmZev1SFtow&index=3&feature=plcp">this Partial POV.</a>

Oh yeah, Matterhorn is closed because they're giving it some kind of makeover. Hopefully it'll be better when they reopen it.
