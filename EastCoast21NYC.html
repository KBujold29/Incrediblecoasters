All right. Time for our first day in New York City on this trip. And hey. Nothing screams NYC more than bagels. So yeah. We're here at some random NYC Bagel Shop.

Fun fact. We were originally just planning on spending the morning quickly at the Statue of Liberty and then spend the rest of the day at Coney Island. However, Coney Island didn't open today thanks to the rain this morning. However, we left the NYC portion of the trip without a strict official schedule (something that worked out beautifully in Japan), and once again, this worked out so well as now we could just do Coney Island on Wednesday and do our NYC Sight-Seeing day today. And now we'll have more time here. =)

Some of the replicas paying homage to one of New York's most famous landmarks (or is it actually in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgZ1f4ACZBQ">New Jersey?</a> A surprisingly difficult and interesting question.)

So the Statue of Liberty originally had a different torch, but they couldn't maintain it. So.....now it's preserved here.

So Liberty Island was cool. Aside from seeing the statue itself, you learn all the standard stuff (It was a gift from France, It's made of copper and is only the color you all recognize because it's actually rusted as f*ck, etc.) and just various things about the Standard American Fairy Tale they teach in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZQl6XBo64M">Elementary School</a>. Clearly, the giant head behind me is also not amused at the whitewashing of history.

I'd welcome you to America, but as you'll soon learn on Ellis Island, I didn't do that nearly as often as you think I did.

 <p>

Liberty Island may be the whitewashed Elementary School approved history lesson, but Ellis Island will actually teach you some things including some aspects of America's dark sh*tty past that many people like to ignore.

Yeah. Anti-Irish Bigotry was a thing in the 1800s (though still not NEARLY as bad as the bigotry against POC). Cleary these assholes never went to a St. Patricks Day party.

So I'm old enough to remember 9/11, but was too young to really understand what was happening, since....I was 9 at the time. I was never shown any of the constant news coverage, and never saw Flight 175 fly into the South Tower. So when I was told "Two planes flew into the World Trade Center", I was thinking those old-school small planes, not a passenger plane. And I assumed that this was property damage and vandalism of a major American landmark, not terrorism where 3,000 people died. So when school excused everyone for mourning the event, I was all "Oh boy! Bonus recess! Why is everyone so sad?", and also said something foolishly ignorant, along the lines "Oh, the police will arrest the man who did this. And this is over in New York. Not here. Let's play now". I also remember everyone being super paranoid and extra panicy, and thinking to myself "Why is everyone so paranoid?", remembering some incident where a giant traffic jam occured because.....I think some cherries or something spilled onto the freeway, and people were afraid it might be a bomb.

Honestly, after seeing <a href="Japan18FujiQ.html">Shibuya Square</a> in the heart of downtown Tokyo, Times Square can't hold a candle to it. Though let's be real. I wasn't a fan of Times Square, even before my Japan Trip.

So I wound up paying $2 for this random CD, before I realized that this was most likely a scam. Also, even if it's not, I don't give a flying f*ck about this guys music. Just upload that sh*t to Youtube dude. Yeah. I'm an idiot. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iayLBI7nsE0">I want mt $2 back!</a> But at least it was only $2. It's the equivelant of losing a Coke. No big deal. And no, I have yet to listen to this stranger's music. Still buried somewhere in my closet.

YES!!! PLEASE ROLL THIS OUT NATIONWIDE!!! I'd LOVE to actually be able to vote my concious and not CONSTANTLY have to vote for a lesser evil that I despise because the alternative is everything I hate about the people I'm voting for, plus psychotic homophobic racist anti-science pro-disease planet-dooming fascists as well. It's a f*cking CRIME that Maine and Alaska are the only two states to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y3jE3B8HsE">Ranked-Choice Voting</a>.

Gotta find some place for dinner that's both nice, and not break-the-bank expensive as well. This seems like it strikes a good balance.

It was a nice resteraunt with good food. But the highlight of the dinner was the debate I had with Scott about literature (Mrs. Dalloway sucks and I will defend that opinion to the death!)

So we decided to close out the night at Stonewall since....three of the four of us are LGBT (including yours truly. Bisexuals! We exist god damn it!). So naturally, it seemed fitting to see the birthplace of the LGBT Rights Movement, and a prominent peice of gay history.

Now I am NOT a bar person. I almost NEVER go to them, usually only going to one bar in L.A a couple times a year for the fun events that they throw. But hey. We're gonna have fun here.

It's OK that this crappy beer is nearly $10 because it's a gay beer. =)

While not the first time I've <a href="TPRCanobieLakePark.html">made a</a> <a href="TPRPhantasialand.html">drunken</a> <a href="TPRSommerlandSjaelland.html">fool</a> of myself on a trip. This time is different. I'm not just drinking for the sake of having fun. I'm celebrating my sexuality and gay history! Now hand my drunken ass another shot lol!
