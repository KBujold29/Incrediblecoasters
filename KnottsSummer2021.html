All right. So theme parks have opened back up in California, and while some places opened back up <a href="SpringSFMM2021.html">right away</a>, Knotts decided to continue with its <a href="TasteofBoysenberryFestival21.html">Taste of Boysenberry Festival</a> for the entire time it was initially planned for before joining SFMM, Disneyland, Sea World, and Universal Studios. But hey. It's over! So let's go to Knotts as a theme park and not just a Food Festival!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostrider61.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know, thanks to not getting on it super often thanks to heavy crowds combined with the pandemic, I sort of forgot that Ghostrider can really provide a kickass ride. Cause this thing can haul ass.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="ghostriderline9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, right when we get off, the line has grown considerably and is out of the building.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator102.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
It's been over a year since my <a href="The2020Update.html">last ride</a> on this. And....yeah. Xcelerator still is the best ride at Knotts and in the Top 5 CA Coasters.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator103.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah, the overbanks after the Top Hat may be filler fluff elements to burn off speed, but it's still fun. Better than Top Thrill Dragster's brake run ending.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds113.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. The crowds don't seem too bad today. That's always a good thing.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="statue113.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I see you still have some leftover theming from the Boysenberry Festival Knotts. =P
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We still have a new for 2020, postponed for 2021 ride to do! Let's finally check out Beary Tales.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Howdy. Glad to see you folks enjoying the ride! Just don't steal our pies! We stole those right out of the rangers pic-a-nic basket and you damn dirty coyotes aren't gonna take it back!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now this technically isn't a new ride as it's just Voyage to the Iron Reef with a new skin and different theming. But for as much as I liked that, this is unquestionably an improvement.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytalesline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Really wish lines were like this all of the time.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales4.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
*Sigh* Damn it. Who let the coyotes out!?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, the ride kind of reminds me of Gobbler Getaway @ Holiday World. Shooting at cute animals in a ride themed to food, works for me. Oh BTW, the ride really smells like Boysenberry Pie. So that gets a big thumbs up from me.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those coyotes never stood a chance. >=) 
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="3dglasses.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Bah! The 3D trend is all over! F*ck this! Throw that sh*t in the garbage!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="soapboxderbyracersstatue.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Knotts continues to capitalize on nostalgia from the older days of the park with their homage to the Soapbox Derby Racers.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="calicoriverrapids6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I know I normally stay away from the rapids rides, but it's been so long and the line is short. Screw it!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="calicoriverrapids7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Did they do something to this ride during the lockdown cause I actually got wet on Calico River Rapids! This is NOT supposed to happen!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="horse9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Uh oh. Knotts, I think some of the stagecoach horses got loose.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="ponyexpress30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
*gasp* The lockdown is over! This means we can go back to riding THE BEST RIDE EVER!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="ghosttown14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, so long Ghost Town. We'll be back for more fun next time.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>

Does anyone else think that that candy's a little stale? It damn-near tastes like plastic!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="shirt15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I've been away from my Peanuts merchandise for far too long.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="knottsberryfarm49.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is this new or did I just never notice this mural for all those years? Regardless, it's really nice and does a great job showcasing the history of the park.
</center>
	
<p>

<img src="hotel29.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OK. This isn't part of a visit to Knotts. But it did take place on their property. So I was picking Jason up from work at the Knotts Hotel since....he works at the park. And naturally, I was late due to a bunch of errands and bullsh*t helping out a "friend" (So glad that that asshole is out of my life). Anyways, it's late, and I see a group of people running out of the hotel screaming. I guess I'm an idiot, cause I see this, don't think it's anything serious. I just rolled my eyes, and shrugged "God damn it. People are stupid. A giant group running into the streets? They're probably attending a wedding for some dumb sh*t like that. Don't run into the f*cking streets". Then heading back home, I notice some of the WORST traffic ever on those streets (It was damn-near Scary Farm bad), and I see a TON of police cars, and thought to myself "Something must've happened here", but never put two and two together until the next day when a bunch of friends and family asked if we were all right and noticed that there was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNAQrBwjTcg">Drive-By Shooting</a> that night and that we were witnissing the aftermath and felt guilty about the snarky comments said in my car not knowing what was going on (I obviously didn't take a photo of the night. This is just a stock photo I took to go with this story)
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="knottsberryfarm50.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another visit. Didn't do a ton of visits to the park thanks to the bullsh*t of life, but hey. We're here, so let's check the park out.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator104.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
For some reason, Xcelerator always seems to have the shortest lines out of the major park coasters. So....yeah. Better get on that now.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="xcelerator105.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Please take good care of this ride Knotts cause it really is awesome.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="statue115.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
We regret to inform you that the K will no longer be part of the Sky Tower. Please be patient as we put a giant boysenberry on top instead.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="soapboxderbyracersstatue2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Knotts. Here's an idea. How about you demolish Coast Rider, recycle your flyers and scrambler (yet again) and rebuild the Wacky Soapbox Racers there. It would be a GIANT improvement over the worst Wild Mouse ever (F*ck those Shin-Guards), and S&S is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2UPF7j3DNI">offering the ride type for sale.</a> #JustDoIt
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="coastrider13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not joking. Do it. *Sigh* I regret to inform myself that they probably won't and that this is wishful thinking. =(
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogride42.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
So this visit happened to be with a large group. Many of whom aren't huge coaster people and definately aren't coaster enthusiasts. So naturally, something like the Timber Mtn Log Ride would be a huge hit with those people.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="timbermtnlogride43.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Why is the ride continously telling us to "SIT DOWN!!!" when everyone here is alredy sitting down?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bearytales7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Yeah yeah. I'm a badass with a high score." "Wait. Didn't somebody beat you?" "Shut the f*ck up!"
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="soda38.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That unlimited drink pass pays for itself in Knotts visits alone. Let alone me also getting good use out of it at Dorney Park, Cedar Point, and Kings Island this year.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds114.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
F*CK!!! THAT'S the line for Silver Bullet!? NOT WORTH IT!!!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevengeline7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
When THIS is the line for Montezoomas Revenge, you know you'e screwed and came on a bad day.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="montezoomasrevenge45.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Sad to see this be part of a dying breed as this really is a ton of fun.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguar25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Holy Sh*t! It's been a while (even excluding the COVID Lockdown) since we last rode this.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguar26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No, we're not insane enough to wait an hour for Jaguar. But we did still wait way too long for it since....again. A lot of non-coaster people were here today.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguarline2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Still will admit that this one of the better lines of any coaster (Potential Future Top 10 List? Maybe once the site FINALLY gets caught up).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="jaguar27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It's nothing crazy, but if you want a nice scenic view of Knotts, then this is a good ride for that.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="supremescream27.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Snore. Riding Supreme Scream is now boring. Can I climb it instead?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="walterknotttheater.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. There's something different about the Charles Schultz....oh wait. It's not called that anymore.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="walterknotttheater2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While Charles Schultz was great, it's only fitting to the name the theater after the park founder. Why am I spending so much time focused on the name of a theater in the park?
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="wifi2.PNG" width="480" height="854" />
</center>
<center>
Now I know they didn't do this in response to <a href="KnottsSummer2019.html">my complaint</a> on it, but thank you for fixing your WiFi Knotts. It's actually usable now, which is really appreciated. Incrediblecoasters really appreciates it.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="crowds115.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good! Go see the Charlie Brown show everyone! Maybe now something will finally have a reasonable line!
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="calicomineride18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Once again, this is what happens when you visit with non-coaster enthusiasts. But hey. Calico Mine Ride is a lot of fun and does have a lot of atmosphere to it. =)
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="stuffedanimal15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. Thank you for the Coyote Pup Stuffed Animals. They just love sitting in my closet collecting dust (Though seriously. I do like them. I just don't have room to have them out).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="soda39.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Sipping on some Boysenberry Chocolate Sasparilla. Good ol' Knotts drinks that.....I'm not gonna lie. I really don't like chocolate flavored things that aren't chocolate (Chocolate Soda just tastes gross. OK?). So....not a huge fan of this.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bobsburgers.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, that was a fun day. Time to end it with dinner at Bob's Burgers.
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bobsburgers2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm not gonna lie. I entirely decided to eat here after driving by it, and because it reminds me of the FOX Show (seriously. That show's really good. It and South Park are the only two adult cartoons that are still good and don't need to be cancelled).
</center>
	
<p>
<center>
<img src="bobsburgers3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unfortunately, the food here, while good, was also fairly generic (Why is it that every single Mom & Pop Burger Joint in SoCal appears to be the same damn resteraunt under a different name?). I want some of the stuff from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basFyoMSjds">the show</a> (I really wanna make the "Baby You Can Chive My Car Burger" sometime). Please make THAT a resteraunt. Given the popularity of the show, I KNOW it would be a huge financial success.
