All right. Time for another Incrediblecoasters Trip. Now, this is a very different trip for Incrediblecoasters as this isn't really a roller coaster trip at all, but rather, this is a cruise. Granted, I do go to a theme park, but that is not the point of this trip at all. This is more of a trip that sort of came out of nowhere and is our big trip of the year. And though it may seem weird that I'm posting a non-coaster update on a coaster site, keep in mind that I've done plenty of non-coaster updates, both on <a href="TarCreekFalls2014.html">cliff jumping</a>, as well as on <a href="GBRTSanFrancisco.html">non-coaster trips</a>. So it's not that crazy. Plus, this trip was freaking awesome, even if it was completely different than what we normally do. And I got to go back to Europe for the 3rd time this decade, which I'm always happy about.

</center>
<center>
I know I complained about United Airlines <a href="TPRCopenhagen.html">last time</a>. Well, this time, I flew on Delta, which I must say, is a BIG improvement. First off, they have the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfFHn6DxvEg">best saftey video ever,</a> featuring a furry, Moses, a sea captain, a cowboy, a woman who's Etch-A-Sketch got ruined, Yo Gabba Gabba!, a 1% doucebag, an owl, a puppeteer complete with puppet, an aging guy, a guy with Google Glass, a guy who has to destroy his elaborate robotic world, and 5 star reviews for the Saftey Guide. But also, though I'm sure other airlines have this, but those USB outlets saved my ass, allowing me to use my Ipod and catch up on podcasts I'm behind on. I highly like this feature.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tibidabo.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. First thing we do while in Europe, is of course, hit the theme park. So we're off to Tibidabo. One of the hardest parks to get to that I've been to.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="trolley2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
First you take this trolly after getting off at the right bus stop.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="barcelona4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Then you get off and have to take a funicular to the top of the mountain.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="funicular.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Seriously, getting to this park is an adventure all in itself. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tibidabo3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yay!! We made it!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="barcelona5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Love the view from this park.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tibidabo4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Tibidabo is a very interesting, strange, and quirky little park. There's really not much like it. The closest I can come to describing this park is that it's sort of like the <a href="TRTGlenwoodSprings.html">Glenwood Caverns Adventure Park</a> of Europe.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tibidabo2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yes, there's a famous church here, but trust me. That's not why we're here. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="muntanyarussa.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Here's our real reason for being here.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="muntanyarussa2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Muntanya Russa is a coaster that's essentially built into the side of the mountain and is currently the only coaster at Tibidabo.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="muntanyarussa4.jpg">
</center>
<center>
If I had to describe this ride in one word, it'd be pretty. There's not anything to really scream about when it comes to the actual roller coaster, it's actually kind of forceless. But it is a very pretty ride, both in it's setting and its design. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="muntanyarussa5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
See that hill right there? No airtime on it whatsoever. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="muntanyarussa6.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
But hey. The views you get from the ride are just phenomenal. So I like it. =)

<center>
For those super whores sad enough to count powered coasters (THEY DON'T COUNT!!!), they have one here for you. And I even rode it.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tibidaboexpress2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I guess I let my imagination get carried away when I thought about the ride (I never really spent time thinking about this ride) because it was much weaker than I was expecting.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="planeonastick.JPG">
</center>
<center>
While Tibidabo has a lot of interesting rides, perhaps its most interesting ride is the Plane on a Stick. Or whatever the hell its real name is.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="planeonastick2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Plane on a Stick is basically this plane that flies in a circle and goes over the edge of the mountain and people freak out about the edge and question the safety of the plane. It's kind of like the rides on the top of the Stratosphere Tower, except looking down on Barcelona > looking down on Las Vegas X1000. 
</center>

You know what sounds good after being on multiple planes for 14 hours flying from Los Angeles to Barcelona? Getting inside another f*cking plane!! =)

I see you Top Spin I didn't ride.
</center>

Ah, there's that view I keep hearing everyone rave about.
</center>

 <p>

</center>
<center>
I can guarantee you that Tibidabo will pop up on our <a href="Top10ParkSettings.html">Top 10 Park Settings List</a>. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="panoramic.JPG">
</center>
<center>
The other ride that people gush about thanks to it being home made and people freaking out because of the view and trusting how its built is the Panoramic, which while it looks like a Skyscraper (THAT WOULD BE F*CKING AWESOME!!!), but sort of acts like a Ferris Wheel.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="panoramic2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I actually had to skip the ride thanks to being short on time. It's a little bit of a bummer, but it's not too big of a deal as I'm assuming that like Plane on a Stick, it's not actually scary and mainly just exists for its beautiful and magnificent view of Barcelona. Oh well.

You really don't have to worry. The food is pretty good, and that's just the lunch stuff. It's much better in the actual resteraunt dining rotation. =)

Three Caballeros is awesome. Definetly one of Disney's underrated films from their World War II non-continous story era, and I wish that Disney did more with Jose and Panchito. Admit it. These three would make a great cartoon for the Disney channel. You know they would.

Today, they taught us to cook Lobster Ravioli accompinied with a South African Wine.

<center>
<img src="anyonecancook3.JPG">

Considering the fact that I mostly cook processed garbage for myself, this was something that I should probably be learning, regardless of whether I'm on a cruise or not.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="anyonecancook4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Now, I don't really like seafood and I remember not liking lobster, but it'd been 11 years since I last tried it, so I gave it another shot. Sorry, but yeah. I'm not really into lobster. But at least the wine was good.

Learning how to draw Mickey Mouse. Hey, I love these animation classes at the Disney parks, and I love them here. I just wish that the cartoons and art I draw were more professional looking and less...crappy.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="picture85.JPG">

<center>
I love these paintings. I know I generally say that people waste way too much money on paintings, art, and general stuff like that. But if I were rich and didn't have to constantly sweat bullets about my financial situation like I currently do, I'd probably get one of these.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="disneymagic3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
For those of you trying to stay in shape (You think you can be healthy on a cruise? LOL. How cute and naieve), they have a running track. Probably should've used this since I am a runner who generally runs on average, 29 miles a week. But f*ck it.

They were playing Disney Bingo where they showed from classic Disney movies (as well as some of their horrible sh*tty forgotton ones. The Pacifier, Beverly Hills Chihuahau? We both know that those movies suck. Don't you try and tell me these are on the same level as Disney classics like Mary Poppins and the Lion King).

Because be honest. How many trap door water slides do you know of on cruise ships? =)

Hey, this is the 3rd (technically 4th) trap door water slide I've done. So I'm curious to see how it is.

Aww. I wish that the original design came to fruition.
</center>

 <p>

</center>
<center>
Honestly, the ride itself is pretty crappy. You know the orange trapdoor slide at Six Flags Hurricane Harbor? The one with the uncomfortable turn that really scratches your back and sprays water down your throat? This is basically the Jr. version of that. But I just like the setting and the idea of this being on a cruise ship so much that I'm pretty forgiving of the flaws, cause yeah. As a whole, the slide is technically bad, even though I had fun.
