<p>
<center>
  <img src="villas8.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
The room card keys here look nice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="villas9.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
The new Villas arn't as good as the Old Villas because they are smaller.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="villas10.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
The hot sun is melting my brain already.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="islands3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Islands, Not quite McDonalds, Not quite Mikados. Just Islands.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="islands4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The theming here is so great that it surpasses Disneyland! Every corner is a sparkling peice of heaven!
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="sign9.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
I wonder what makes the Happy Hour such a Happy Hour?

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="model5.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But the cops won't catch me in the Sprinklers! I, Britney Spears II will LIVE ON FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  <img src="pool6.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pool7.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here is the Rock Waterfall.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="chess.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sorry, But playing Chess won't stop your brains from melting and getting stupider.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pool8.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Even the kiddy pool looks very nice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="villas12.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Heres a glimpse of the old villas.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here is the Original Palm Springs Marriot Hotel. Still Very Nice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotel4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Wow. On the inside, It looks diffrent from <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/hotel.jpg">last time.</a>

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="parrots2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

They put the parrots in cages! And they took their lovers away! I guess they don't want any more Baby Parrots. Or they could just buy Parrot Condoms, But thats too expensive. So no more kissing for this parrot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="brightonshop.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT! PALAPAS IS GONE!!! THAT STORE WAS A PEICE OF S**T FROM WHEN I FIRST SAW IT!!!!!! But this is crappy as well.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelboat.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Time to take the Hotel Boat over to Mikados.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="hotelboat2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Onion Volcanos, Here I come!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados9.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Finally! I get to return to one of my favorite resteraunts!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados10.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Enter into a Resteraunt with humor.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="moomoo2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
According to Celeste, This is Moo Moo. To her, Fish live forever.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados11.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
With the power of Chopsticks, I can pick up ANYTHING!!!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados12.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Let me get the dissapointment part of the update out of the way, I did not take any pictures of the Onion Volcano, Throwing Shrimp in mouths our any fire. That was all on video.
(Which is not posted on the internet.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados13.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Heres a look at what you eat at Mikados.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados14.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What makes Mikados so good is the fact that they have a sense of humor. The chefs tell jokes and have fun with everything. No boring waiting for your food to come time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados15.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Heres the traditonal Mikados salt message. When you're doing photographing the message, pour the salt into a neighbors wound and watch them scream like hell!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mikados16.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And they let you smoke wafer here. With twice as much nictotine as a cigarette and four times as likely to give you cancer than marijuana!
</center>

Welcome to Soak City Palm Springs! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="statue6.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Here is their legendary Surfing Statue.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfriderrapids6.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Still one of Soak Citys Best Rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfriderrapids7.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Every inch of this ride is filled with fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfriderrapids8.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Riding this again just proves how much High Extreme sucks!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pacificspin.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And here is Soak Citys new ride! Another Tornado Clone.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pacificspin2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
But this version is better because it does more stuff before it drops into the funnel.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seasnake.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Heres another good slide at Soak City Palm Springs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="seasnake2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
The Pitch Blackness reminds me of my own empty head.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="undertow.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Undertow is another fun slide here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pipeline.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Pipeline is a claustrophobic mans idea of torcher.

</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wipeoutPS2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Wipeout is the biggest dissapointment at Soak City Palm Springs. I knew it was a mild slide, But I didn't think that Silver Bullet had 5000 times more force than this peice of crap.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pipelinepointtower.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here you can see Wipeout, Pipeline and Undertow all in the same picture. Try and guess which slide is which and the first person who emails me with the right answer will get a dollar.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="undertow2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Here is a good shot of ********. (No you will not get the dollar because I'm not telling you which slide this is)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="kahunabeachhouse.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Proof that we're in Palm Springs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="soakcityps3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
A good look at Kahunas Beach House with Pacific Spin in the background.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwavetower.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Time for your big backscrathing wedgie giving drop slide.
</center>

<p>

<center>
  <img src="tidalwavetower2.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
This one has a really good location though. I give them thumbs up for not ruining it. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwavetower3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Its actually much less painful than Venom Drop.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign11.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
  Aww. I was hoping that this was one of the waterslides they had here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sleepy3.jpg" width="640" height="481" />
</center>
<center>
Wow. The heat will be my new lullaby. It works like a charm. Almost a little too well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="CPK.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Everybody loves pizza...because we executed everyone who doesn't!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="croquet.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We played Croquet on our last day here. And the next set of photos are the Celeste sucks at Croquet Photos.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="croquet2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>

<center>
Here you see Celeste pathetically failing to hit the ball into the hole less than half an inch in front of her.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="croquet3.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here you see Celeste fall on her ass trying to hit the ball into the hole.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="croquet4.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Here you see Celeste about to tenderize the ground to make the ball move.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ducks2.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And the ducks from Disneyland flew all the way here just to laugh at Celeste!
