All right. Its time for yet another amazing Incrediblecoasters Road Trip. This time, we decided to head on up to Lagoon in Salt Lake City, UT. After Cody had visited the park in 2010 and raved about how great it was, I knew it was high on my to visit list. Then in 2011, we were planning on doing this road trip with Caeser. But thanks to his divorce problems and sh*tty car, we had to cancel the trip. But that attempt at the trip with Ceaser made us want to do it more and more. And with the overwhelming success of the <a href="GBRTSanFrancsico.html">Glass Beach Road Trip</a>, which was our first ever road trip, we decided to do it in 2013 with Alisa. Then a week before the trip started, we met a friend, and he joined us on the trip. And here we are, on our way to Lagoon!!! =)

<center>
All right. First stop of the morning, the Barstow Train Station for breakfast and stretching our legs.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="barstowtrainstation2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! This place is awesome!!! I finally found something in Barstow that I actually like!!! (Oh, and BTW, Hi Brittney and David) =).
</center>

 <p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
Trust me. We are totally gonna have an ass kicking day.

<center>
Quick stop at the abandoned water park anyone?
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="zzyzxroad.JPG">
</center>
<center>
If there's any random road at the Mojave Desert we're stopping at, it's totally Zzyzx Rd.

<center>
Just so you know, that is indeed the worlds largest thermometer. And no. It does not work.

</center>
<center>
Hey everyone!!! Only 502 more miles to go!!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="road11.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Oh god!!! Not the valley!!! This is by far the worst part of the whole drive to Salt Lake City!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="desperado4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Damn you Buffalo Bills!!!! Why can't you have a decent operating schedule so we can get on Desperado!!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="road12.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Is it me, or have we been in the desert for so long that I'm starting to hallucinate?
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="lasvegas.JPG">
</center>
<center>
We'll be back for you on Monday Las Vegas.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="virginrivergorge.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Ok. This is just freaking awesome. The 15 Freeway just slices through the Virgin River Gorge in Arizona like butter. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign273.JPG">
</center>
<center>
We have officially crossed the state line and are now in Utah.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="crackerbarrel.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. For lunch, we stopped at Cracker Barrel since I hadn't eaten there before and was told that they were really good.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="crackerbarrel2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We sure ain't in California no more.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="crackerbarrel3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This place is amazing!!! I absolutely loved the food here!!! We need this place to come to CA and we'll totally be eating here in Texas.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="feild8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
You can tell we're in Utah now because its pretty outside.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rainstorm19.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And yeah. It actually rains here in Utah. And considering how we only got 3 inches of rain and had to seriously cut our cliff jumping season super short because of it, we need A LOT more rain in California.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="mountain9.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! There's still snow in Utah!!! You could go skiing right now if you really wanted to!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="truck2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey truck. Thanks for randomly deciding to switch lanes and not even look to see if anyone was there. Next time, uses your mirrors before you merge asshole.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rainbow2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUmXhCmVaQg">Hey. What if this rainbow doesn't actually exist and its just all in our imagina...</a>
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="cowabungabay.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey Shane. That's a nice waterpark you have there. Too bad we won't be stopping there though.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="saltlakecity.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. We're finally in Salt Lake City.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked.JPG">
</center>
<center>
WE DID IT!!!! WE MADE IT TO LAGOON IN ONE DAY!!!!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hard to belive that at 4:00 am, we were all the way in Ventura, and now at 5:00 pm, we are here at Lagoon.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="lagoon.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Our original plan was to just go in and take pictures and video and ride stuff on Sunday. But then we found out that they changed the system and instead of doing tickets, they just did a single admission and unlimited rides for the rest of the day. So we paid an extra $45 for an extra day at Lagoon so we could get our night shots. And hey. More time at Lagoon to ride stuff and have fun. I'm happy with this. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And yeah. First order of buisness, Wicked. This is a coaster I've been interested in ever since I first saw it. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
That airtime hill may not be super intense, but its fun. And actually fairly fast despite those trims.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
And that heartline twist has some seriously good hangtime.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Oh hey Laser. <a href="ThrillCoastersDorneyPark">Long time, no see.</a> Hows it going?
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Its essentially Laser from Dorney Park. Except its in Utah and not now traveling the German Fairs.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
So glad that there's still rides like this left in the world because they really are awesome rides.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wildmouseLAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Up next, the Wild Mouse.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wildmouseLAGOON2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This has to take the award for my favorite Wild Mouse. First off, the program is insane to the point that it makes the European Mice seem tame.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wildmouseLAGOON3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Plus, it goes through a house. How freakin awesome is that!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Lots of great shots of Roller Coaster from the parking lot. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="lagoon2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This park is f*cking awesome.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="fountain15.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This fountain at the front of the park is just a ton of fun to play in and run around.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="fountain16.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Artsy shot.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
The extra $45 was worth it for the night shots alone.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="turnofthecentury.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This park just comes to life at night. So beautiful.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="swan.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey Alisa. Wouldn't you rather have an owl right here?
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="skyscraperLAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Look at all the pretty lights.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! Next up, we're doing Jet Star 2!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
While sitting in the back is uncomfortable on your legs, this is a completely INSANE ride. Its crazy to the point of making the Whizzer want to commit suicide.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Collosus the Fire Dragon at night.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Love all the pretty lights.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Best way to end this day is with some night rides on Wicked.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This place is awesome. I can't wait to come back tomorrow.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="saltlaketemple.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. Before we head off to Lagoon, we decided to check out the Salt Lake Temple. Cause hey. Its pretty.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="saltlaketemple2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This place is to Mormons what Vatican City is to Catholics.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="templesquare.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I gotta admit. I really like Salt Lake City. Its got a unique vibe here isn't any city quite like it. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="saltlaketemple3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Plus the air here is actually nice to breathe unlike in L.A. This would be a great place to go running.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="saltlaketemple4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Welcome to Mormonland.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="fountain17.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Pretty fountain.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="templesquare2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
More prettiness from Salt Lake City.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign274.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Hey Cody!!! Don't you wanna take a detour and extend the trip to Cheyanne!!? Bet you'd love that. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="lagoon3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
We're back for Round 2 of Fun at Lagoon!! =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAGOON2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Lagoon ranks up there as one of the most beautiful parks I've visited.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="lagoon4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
More Lagoon prettiness.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="cinnamonroll.JPG">
</center>
<center>
The Cinnamon Rolls at Lagoon are really good and do make for a great brunch/lunch.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="river8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Not sure if this creek was here before Lagoon or if Lagoon added it. Either way, I love it.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rattlesnakerapids.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Gotta thank Cody for talking me into riding their rapids ride, cause it is GREAT!!! My 2nd favorite rapids ride only behind River Quest @ Phantasialand. This ride not only gets you soaking wet via waterfall, but it has great rapids and goes through a really pretty garden. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Another one of Lagoon's charms is their Pioneer Village they have hidden in the back of the park. Its a great place to look at 18th Century Utah and explore what things were like. For instance, a coffins supposed to go inside there.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I really wish Knott's Ghost Town was as nice as Pioneer Village. I'd spent a lot more time there if it was.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Something tells me that Cody wants that Pennyfarther.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
What do you mean I have to back to the Dentist's Office!!? I just got 5 cavities last month!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Will you kindly have a seat?
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Look at the bright side. You may have gotten all your teeth yanked out with no anesthetics, but at least you'll get to drink some good Whisky.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to get the rest of the credits at Lagoon.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This is dedicated to anyone reading this with a fear of spiders.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Spider is another one of those Mauher Shone Spinning Coasters.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'm spoiled by Winjas, but this is still a great ride.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
We gotta get more of these rides built and I'm glad that the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk is getting a clone of this.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="spiderLAGOON6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
These rides do quite a good amount of spinning. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Up next, Roller Coaster.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign275.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Leave it in both colors. It's funkier that way. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I gotta admit. This ride has to take the award for exceeding my expectations the most on the entire trip.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I was expecting this ride to be a cruiser snoozer similar to High Roller @ Valleyfair.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster5.JPG">
</center>
<center>
But this was a really fun roller coaster that was a ton of fun and just flowed really well.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
There's actually airtime right there. Its not super strong or anything, but its there.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
It's not gonna crack my Top 10 List, but its a very fun ride. 
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="rollercoaster8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
STOP!!!!! You guys are the lucky train to get a double ride. Glad I got it as its a fun ride.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="puffthefiredragon.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yes. I am a credit whore.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="bombora.JPG">
</center>
<center>
After Puff the Fire Dragon, this actually gonna thrill me.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="bombora2.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
Hey, its a Non-Vekoma Roller Skater that plays Surf Music in the mountains of Utah. I can't complain about that. =)
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="batLAGOON.JPG">
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to get the last credit needed at the park.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="batLAGOON2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Oh joy. Another kiddy SLC.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="batLAGOON3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yep. Its a rough one. I think Vekoma should require from now on that all kiddy SLCs should be required to have lap bars like <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/jimmyneutronsatomicflyer.jpeg">the one at Movie Park Germany.</a>
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="airraceLAGOON.jpeg">
</center>
<center>
I can't believe that there are only two Air Races in the world!!! These rides are AWESOME!!!! They didn't make my <a href="Top10FlatRides.html">Top 10 Flat Rides List</a> for nothing!!!
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="terrorride.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Not nearly as cheesy as I was expecting.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! Time for more rides on Wicked.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked9.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Just in case you're wondering how Wicked works.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked10.JPG">
</center>
<center>
That launch tower on Wicked is very...interesting. Its like its got two mini launches. A launch at the bottom. Go up, lose speed. Launch again, go fast. Crawl at the top. Drop down vertically.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked11.JPG">
</center>
<center>
I can't think of any ride that is similar to Wicked.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked12.JPG">
</center>
<center>
After a fun first half, it kind of gets weak in the second half.
</center>

 <p>
<center>
<img src="wicked13.JPG">
</center>
<center>
But even the second half has some fun laterals on the 90 degree sideways turns.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon6.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yes. I would like more rides on the Schwarzkoph please.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
If you sit on the ride alone and don't brace for the laterals, it'll literally knock you down. =)
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon8.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Why are these rides so rare? =(
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="sign276.JPG">
</center>
<center>
For as much as I love Lagoon, there is only one flaw with the park. The no single riders rule in the front and back on Collosus and the Bat. I get why they have it, but I'm sorry. It's still a stupid rule that I feel they should'nt have. But whatever. Lagoon is still freaking awesome.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="centennicalscreamer.JPG">
</center>
<center>
The enterprise here runs great. Why can't other U.S parks run their enterprise this well?
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="cliffhanger.JPG">
</center>
<center>
For as trippy as this Top Spin looks, its actually fairly tame. 
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="draculascastle.JPG">
</center>
<center>
This was actually a really cool dark ride. And it went on for a lot longer than I expected.
</center>


  <p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON3.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Between this and Collosus, I am very pleased that Lagoon is preserving all these great Schwarzkophs.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="jetstar2LAGOON4.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Its called Jet Star 2 because you take a #2 while riding.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="samauri.JPG">
</center>
<center>
HOLY SH*T!!! THIS TOP SCAN RUNS SUCH A GOOD PROGRAM!!!!! =D
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="rocket.JPG">
</center>
<center>
The S&S Tower may run a weak program, but at least it looks nice.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="collosusfiredragon9.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I feel a ride on Collosus in the rain is in order.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="rainstorm20.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Yep. Unlike many U.S parks that close when a raindrop hits the ground, everything at Lagoon stays open. Another reason I love this park.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="pioneervillage7.JPG">
</center>
<center>
Another great use for the Pioneer Village. Shelter from the rain.
</center>

Damn. Its raining HARD outside.

Sweet. Lets take a ride on the skyride.

Lagoon is one of the few parks in the country that gets the concept of bumper cars is to *gasp* BUMP PEOPLE!!!!! None of this bullsh*t with no head-on bumping, one way rules, or flat out no bumping rules. Just go for it. =)
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="skyscraperLAGOON2.JPG">
</center>

All right. Lets get some shots from the Ferris Wheel.
</center>

  <p>
<center>

To make this park even more awesome, the Ferris Wheel is also a teacup ride. =)
