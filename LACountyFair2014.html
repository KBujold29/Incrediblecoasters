All right. Its time for our yearly fair visit at the L.A County Fair. This was another successful year at the Fair with lots of rides and fun. And we started out with lunch at Sonic, cause apparently there's a lot more in California than I originally thought, which is good since I really enjoyed it back in Texas.

Quick little tip for anyone who plans on going to the L.A County Fair. Go to O'Reilleys and get your ticket and unlimited wristband for only $25. It's a great deal and saved me a ton of money. I just wish I found out about this last year when I took my half-assed visit to the fair <a href="LACountyFair2013.html">last year</a> and didn't do much to save money due to being on financial lockdown. I'm still in financial lockdown and I managed to get on everything this year, plus I spent just as much money last year as I did this year. Much smarter visit to the fair.

<p>

<img src="lacountyfair8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yay!!! We made it to the L.A County Fair!!!
</center>

<p>

<center>
Just what I've been waiting all year to ride!! The L.A County Fair Log Flume!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tango10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of course, you all know that the real reason we came here was for Tango, easily one of the <a href="Top10FlatRides.html">best flat rides</a> ever made.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="gopro.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
While on Tango, something interesting happened. My GoPro was in Codys zippered pocket, except Cody didn't bother to zip it up. Quick tip. ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOUR ZIPPERED POCKETS ARE SECURE!!! I know I'm the paranoid kind who always double checks when getting on a ride. Triple checks when on something really crazy like Tango or DejaVu. Well, knowing Tango and all the crazy flips it does, my GoPro falls out of Cody's pocket and onto the ground. I yell at him for being a dipsh*t, he tells me to relax and that its fine, and sure enough, its fine. Because GoPros are f*cking awesome and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrxPuk0JefA">super endurable.</a> This thing just fell 60 ft onto a metal platform and those teeny tiny marks are the only damage it ensued. Codys lucky that this was my GoPro which could've handled this and not one of my other cameras, otherwise I would've killed him.

Ooh. Nice list of people you've got playing. I would've gone to see Heart play, except you have to pay for the concerts here, and I am not in a financial situation to be going to concerts at the moment.

Thanks for bringing the sharks out just for us.

</center>
<center>
And since we have a carousel enthusiast with us today, we had to take multiple spins on the Carousel.
</center>

<p>
<center>

Nice Porcupine. I want to pet the porcupine.

Yep. The time has come for another round of Mojo's Monkey Mania. =)

Can I please just run straight into the fountain?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="camel4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is that camel actually dead or is it just playing dead to try and avoid us?

Stupid Emu who tried to eat my camera. =)

<center>
Well, we saw the owls. Alisa's day has been made.

<p>

<img src="timbermtnslide2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
Again, I am really not a fan of these types of slides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="carouselLAF6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If a carousel is in sight, it must be ridden. End of story.

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed6.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
That's enough exhibits, animals, and tame rides. I wanna do something extreme!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After riding the crappy version at Power Park, I only appreciate Speed even more.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="speed8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPEED IS GOOD!!! SPEED IS GOOD!!! SPEED IS GOOD!!!

Holy Crap!! Mega Drop is MUCH stronger than I remembered 2 years ago. =)

<img src="skyflyer7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sure. Why not take a ride on the Star Flyer?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="skyflyer5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You know what? After thinking about it and riding many great starflyers, I'm revoking this rides Star Flyer Privelages. You're no longer a Star Flyer unless you're at least over 100 ft. Otherwise, you're just elevated chairswings.
</center>

<p>

Crazy Coaster (we did not ride it) from the L.A County Fair Elevated Chairswings.

<center>
<img src="zipper15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I can wait on the Zipper. I'd rather wait for the Santa Barbara Fair where it runs so crazy that it becomes my favorite flat ride of all time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="horse4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't feel bad for these horses. They're one of the few lucky <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU">employed horses.</a>

<img src="creepshow2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
In tradition of riding sh*tty fair dark rides, we take a spin on the (Not) Creep Show.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="creepshow3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes, this ride is so bad that even the animatronics are trying to escape.
</center>

You're in luck. Lots of these idiots are illiterate, so you'll get your wish.

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="giantwheel5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we have to take a spin on the Giant Wheel from the L.A County Fair.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="lacountyfair9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

I love the view of the L.A County Fair from the Giant Wheel.

One of these days, I'm gonna finally try that damn doughnut burger.

  <p>
<center>
<img src="deepfriedfood.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sadly, I was not able to try a new deep fried food at this years fair because...money. Financial Lockdown won't let me justify spending $8 for Deep Fried Doritos. Oh well. I'd still much rather give up my deep fried food than give up my wristband like I did last year. Much smarter move.

I don't get all the pussies who say that this ride hurts. Just get on it and enjoy the insanity. =)

New at the L.A County Fair this year was Galaxi.

<center>
<img src="galaxyLAF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I was excited to get a new credit at the L.A County Fair, but then I heard that this was just <a href="BackdraftPhotos.html">Backdraft</a> from the Ventura County Fair WAY back in <a href="VenturaCountyFair2005.html">2005</a>. But after riding this one, I'm still not sure. It might be a different ride, or it might just be a painted and renamed Backdraft. I don't know. All I do know is that when in doubt, always air on the safe side of "Not a new Credit". 
</center>

    <p>
<center>
<img src="galaxyLAF3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All I know is that if this really is Backdraft, then its MUCH better than I remembered it with a few pops of actually decent airtime.
</center>

    <p>
<center>
<img src="wipeoutLAF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

I also don't remember this Wipeout ride being here in previous years. But its fun. =)

Man, I'm really lucky today with single riders!! =)

<center>
Aww. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdOPBP9vuZA">I slipped in the fun house.</a>
</center>

    <p>
<center>
<img src="musicexpressLAF2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
These rides are much more fun when you don't have three people squished in one car.
</center>

    <p>
<center>
<img src="rockit4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really enjoyed RockIt much more when I don't have have to fish out 9 freaking tickets to ride.
</center>

   <p>
<center>
<img src="moscowcircus4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. If I was annoyed by anything at this years fair, its the inconsistancy with the names. Backdraft is now Galaxy, RockIt is now Experience, Speed is now Mach 1, and the Moscow Circus is now the Fun Factory. Whatever, not a big deal.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="moscowcircus5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Moscow Circus is still the best funhouse here.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="moscowcircus6.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
That spiral slide is much faster than you'd think. =)
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="sign355.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I really wanted to see all the pretty lights in there, but...money.
</center>

  <p>
<center>
<img src="giantwheel6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, another year at the L.A County Fair has come and gone. I'm really glad that I got to ride Tango as well as all the other crazy flat rides this year and hope next year is even more insane.
