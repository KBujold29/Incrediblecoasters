Ok, so today was the one day where we go to Six Flags Hurricane Harbor to go check out all the awsome slides they have there.
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
And this day would have never been possible if it wern't for this magic coupon. Three cheers for the coupon!

Instead of turning left into Magic Mtn like we always do, today we're turning right into Hurricane Harbor.
</center>

OK Six Flags, time to be honest here. You did a terrible job repainting the play area. That yellow is ugly as hell and really hurts my eyes. It's almost as ugly as <a href="ThrillCoastersGeaugaLake.html">Thunderhawk back when it wasw @ Geauga Lake.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="losttemplerapids.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. The play area wasn't the only thing that recieved a fresh coat of paint.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="losttemplerapids2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lost Temple Rapids also ended up getting a new coat of paint and unlike the play area, it actually looks nice.
</center>

"I see random crap over there. I WANT IT!!! I WANT IT!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="crapreach2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"SO CLOSE!!! SO CLOSE TO THAT RANDOM CRAP!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stairs2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
While Magic Mtn has the M&M Staircase, Hurricane Harbor has this Skittles Staircase. Complete with a tounge to lick the crap off your feet while you walk up the stairs.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tabootower5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here you can see that Taboo Tower has not one, but three awsome slides. Well, they're not Wild Rivers awsome, but we had fun on them.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="venomdrop3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now for the star attraction of the park. The one slide that has people staring at you when you go down, Venom Drop.
</center>

What are all these cars doing here!? Shoo!! Get out of here! Go to the Staples Center for Michael Jackson's funeral! Just go away (It actually wasn't actually that crowded)!
</center>

Good Bye Six Flags Hurricane Harbor. See you next year.

I HATE this intersection. I hate it with all my heart. If there is a street intersection hell, then this intersection will go there when it gets destroyed.

OK. The Hurricane Harbor fun is now over. Time to go back to the same old Magic Mountain routine. And since Superman was going quite high today, we went straight up the mountain to go ride it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. I can't fool myself. I miss the water in Hurricane Harbor. And since I can't go back there, I might as well get on a water ride.
</center>

<p>

  <img src="sign75.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I smell a big steaming pile of bulls**t.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep. I was right. Incrediblecoasters 1. Sign 0.

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge75.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And now it's time to ride everyone's favorite Stand Up coaster in Southern California, Riddlers Revenge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge76.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You may have the speed, the height, the forces, the inversions, and the records Riddlers. But you still need some of that sweet ejector air Cobra has.
