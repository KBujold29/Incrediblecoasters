<center>
Ok, so today, we were at SFMM's Rock'N'Ride New Years Eve Party to celebrate New Years Eve and go into 2010 in style.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign89.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. So here's the story about how Incrediblecoasters got this to be our New Years Tradition. It all started New Years Eve in 2008. Cody and I were playing WarioWare because we were bored. Eventually, we got tired of WarioWare when Cody said "I'm bored. I wanna go to Magic Mtn." I then said "Yeah, I do too." Cody then said something along the lines of "You know they've got a Brand New New Years Event they're starting out this year." Then we ended up going to SFMM and attending the event. I never made an update on it because I didn't bring my camera which I never bothered to bring because of the sudden notice and the fact that Incrediblecoasters was down at the time cause of the Big PC Crash. But at the event, we decided to make it a New Years Tradition and to do a big update on it next year.

In other news, they painted this building and it totally looks awesome!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign90.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We'll get to all the music, dancing, and 2010 celebrating later. For now, it's all about rollercoaster riding.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ninja23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Our first coaster of the day was in fact, Ninja.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ninja24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We are totally ready for Ninja. Oh, and this nice ride op took this pic of us. Thanks Dude. You're awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ninja25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ninja wasn't running that great today. 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
"HOLY CRAP!!!! BATMAN IS BLUE!!!!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermantheescape22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. Something's missing here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermantheescape23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HOLY CRAP!!!! SUPERMAN IS GONE!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermantheescapeline.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. I guess without Superman on the tower, people just don't want to ride it anymore.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="supermantheescape23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We ended up marathoning Superman in honor of our long gone friend, Superman.
</center>

</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="terminator37.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
There was really alot of airtime on the ride today!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dejavu30.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next would indeed be DejaVu.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dejavu31.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Those 90 degree lifthills are really awesome.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="dejavu32.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"OH SH*T!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign92.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Sweet!! We don't have to wait in any more lines!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign93.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Cranberry Nut Fudge? I am SO trying that!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fudge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"You know, it's kind of like Chocolate Covered Bacon."
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign94.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!! I thought you were dead? What happened to Terminator and why are you back?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign95.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
I still see Freefall in that picture.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldrusher27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Next up was Goldrusher.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goldrusher28.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's an interesting fact. Goldrusher used to be red. (A really ugly shade of red.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="troll3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
Breaking News on Incrediblecoasters. This BBQ Place is really freaking awesome and definetly the best place to eat at SFMM.
</center>

<center>
Goliath is proudly sponsered by Driving Force. Because everyone should drive somewhere after going through a powerful fake helix of death.
</center>

<p>

<img src="sign97.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

Sorry Newhall Saugus Boys Club. But...
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bushes.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We took out our fountains and replaced them with these bushes. (They really should put those fountains back.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride46.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Batman!!! Why are you blue??
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride47.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm Blue! Da Ba Dee Da Ba Da!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride48.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Eiffel 65 predicted the future!!! Quick, we must inform Obama about their superhuman powers!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliath59.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goliath is all shiney now!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliath70.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But they're not quite done painting it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream56.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look! They gave Scream a brand new sign!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batmantheride49.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Blue Batman from Scream's line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream57.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now with that new sign comes new screams.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bucanneer9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Since we brought Andrew with us, we HAD to ride the Pirate Ship.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="bucanneer10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oops. We brought the wrong Andrew.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="logjammersoak8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Despite it being New Years Eve and not hot at all, some people were stupid enough to ride Log Jammer. And that means we just HAD to soak them.
</center>

"Hey!!! I'm not supposed to get wet on the water ride!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="goliath61.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Goliath is even shiney across the park.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="Xline6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
X2 may have a line, but I don't care.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="viper51.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Here's a puddle formed from yesterday's rain. (And you can see Hair Gel's reflection in it.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="X64.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
X2 was completely badass, as usual.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="view2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Don't worry Magic Mtn. We'll be right back.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="street2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Grr! I'm Cody and I'm in the middle of the street!! Gimme an SUV!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wendys2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok. That is bullsh*t.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="wendys3.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"HOLY CRAP!!! THE CUP WAS RIGHT!!! IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FROWN WHILE EATING A FROSTY!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="party.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Night falls and the party begins.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign100.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for us to make total asses of ourselves.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="ddr2.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Failure Vs Failure. FIGHT!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tatsu52.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for Tatsu at night!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="tatsu53.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ignore the blue sky in the background. It was indeed night time when we rode.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="terminator38.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
That was one awesome ride on Terminator we had.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="file:///Macintosh HD/Users/kevin/Documents/Incrediblecoasters/riddlersrevenge82.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Afterwards, we went to go ride Riddlers Revenge. (All our Riddlers Photos were taken in the evening.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="riddlersrevenge83.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
Riddlers was running much better than it was last New Years Eve.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign99.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You smell.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="sign101.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Solve the math problem. How many people can ride Orient Express if 78+1 people can ride?
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="logjammersoak11.jpeg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We then realized that there were STILL stupid people riding Log Jammer, including Pink Sweater Girl. Pink Sweater Girl said alot of stuff to us including "I'M FREEZING!!!!!", "I HATE YOU GUYS!!!!!!", and "F*CK YOU GUYS!!!!!!!" We love you too Pink Sweater Girl. Thanks for the free laughs you gave us.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="canyonblaster11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Pink Sweater Girl!!! Come ride Canyon Blaster with us!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="balloons6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to give the insane spinning balloons a try since it's been a while since we've ridden them and honestly, I just didn't spin that much. (Though Cody claims they haven't changed a bit, so it's probably just my sh*tty spinning skills.)
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="X65.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for our last coaster of the year.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="X66.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
On Cold Nights like this, instead of fire, they should spray Liquid Nitrogen in your face instead.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="party2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
The party is still going on and people are dancing to various songs I listen to on my car radio.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="coke.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
They may have ran out of little coke bottles, but that's not going to stop me from drinking Coke when it turns 2010.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="batman.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"You got a problem with my new paint job punk?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="countdown.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It won't be 2009 for long.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="party3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Headcheez!! Where were you? Mr. Six was looking foreward to dancing with you again!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. It's 2010 now!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike last year, SFMM actually put on a fireworks show!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
2010 may be great now, but just wait for January 4th when Vacation is over and we're all back to our boring misreble schedules. Then tell me how 2010 is.
</center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="fireworks12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Anyways, SFMM put on a FANTASTIC Fireworks Show and had a FANTASTIC EVENT!!! We WILL be back and wish you all a happy 2010!!!
