All right. And finally, we checked out the Disneyland Resort for Christmas Time, as this is pretty much the one time we visit now. And hey look! Matterhorn and Big Thunder Mtn in the same shot. Surprised I just noticed this.
</center>
 
  <p>
<center>
<img src="rainstorm33.jpg">
</center>
<center>
And of course, it's raining. Hey, it may not have made the park dead like back in <a href="DisneylandXmas2010.html">2010</a>, but it DEFINETLY helped with the crowds. Also, California has really been getting a lot of rain recently. This is great not only to help with our f*cking drought, but it should make for a surprisingly good cliff jumping season in 2017.

Not bad (at least by my standards. I suck at shooting dark rides!).

Hey look. It's Hyperspace Mountain again. I'm assuming they're doing this so that they can cash in on Rouge One (Not a bad movie, but far from the best Star Wars movie).
</center>
  
  <p>
<center>
<img src="spacemtn84.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Look Disney. I get that you want to do new things. It's fun to experiment with rides. And Hyperspace Mountain was fun the first time. But please change it back to normal Space Mountain. In Hyperspace Mountain, you can see the track at times, and it sort of reveals itself as the coaster it really is. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCMX7Cmcxus">normal soundtrack</a> gives a sensation of speed and zooming around space while Hyperspace Mountain is focused too much on cramming in Star Wars that you start to notice what the ride would be like naked and outside.

It appears that we've run into a Space Ocean (Yes. That is a <a href="http://www.space.com/12400-universe-biggest-oldest-cloud-water.html">real thing</a>).

It may be the first modern steel coaster, but it's still running really good.

Disney, you might want to dispatch less logs. I know that's weird to say. But if you're this clogged up, it might be a smart idea to unclog.

Yeah. We're idiots for riding this. But this shouldn't be too surprising, given that we live in Idiotland.

All right. Let's go over and check out Soaring Over California.
</center>

<center>
Huh. There's something different about the Soaring logo.

Wait. Why are we over South America? What does this have to do with California?
</center>
    
    <p>
<center>
<img src="soaring12.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. I can't keep it up anymore. Over the summer, California Adventure actually changed it to Soaring Around the World. Now I TOTALLY understand why they did this at Epcot, considering how that park is themed to all around the world. It makes sense for it to be Soaring Around the World. But this is California Adventure. Soaring Over California works here. But I went in with an open mind (and didn't spoil the ride), and I'm going to be honest. I absolutely LOVED Soaring around the World. It hits me right in the travel bone. I love all the places they showcase. I want to see them all. I absolutely love it. A major improvement. So glad they changed it. Sorry Disney Purists. This one is better.
</center>
    
    <p>
<center>
<img src="soaring13.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Now don't get me wrong. I did enjoy Soaring Over California. I did like it (Always good to ride a simulator showcasing you around where you live). But don't worry. You can still essentially ride Soaring Over California <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Krho-nkiho">from your home</a>. It was a simulator. And the movement wasn't that much. Though yeah. It is a bummer you can't get the orange smell (speaking of which, the smells on Soaring around the World are GREAT!! You smell grass at Mt. Kilimanjaro, Jasmine at the Taj Mahal, and ocean scent at Fiji).

Hey. We may not be huge show people, but we will check it out when Disney comes out with a new show. So of course, we had to see their new Frozen show, which finally replaced their Aladdin show.
</center>
   
   <p>
<center>
<img src="frozenshow2.JPG">
</center>
<center>
In good news, the Frozen show is good. Very damn good. But sorry. It's not as good as the Aladdin Show.

	But hey. That's not to diss on the Frozen show. It's really good. Honestly, it just shows how good the Aladdin show was. I mean, look at our <a href="Top10ParkShows.html">Top 10 Theme Park Shows List</a>.

OK. One flaw with the show that I really didn't like. Sven talks in the play. I don't like that. I like that Sven doesn't talk. I love the Disney animals that don't talk. I know that you make changes when adapting a movie into a play. But making Sven talk is not a necessary change.

   <p>
<center>
<img src="towerofterror40.jpg">
</center>
<center>
OK. We have to ride and talk about Tower of Terror. Because if you haven't heard already (get out from under that rock), they're turning Tower of Terror into Guardians of the Galaxy. Uh...WHAT!!? Look. I know people will scream at Disney for changes they make to their attractions. I was neutral about them turning Maelstrom into Frozen at Epcot (I actually did ride Maelstrom. I just never got photos or put it in the update), and you just heard me rave about Soaring Around the World and praise Disney for that change. I don't have too much of a problem with the changes the park was doing while other people were complaining and bitching. But honestly, this is where I draw the line. I HATE the Guardians of the Galaxy makeover. It just seems...random. No wait, scratch that. It's not random. It's a cash grab because Guardians of the Galaxy is big now. It feels like it's going to be dated soon. I feel like they're just thinking about the short term conjunction and collaberation of the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 being released in May. The design, while I will admit, it looks kind of cool. But I just don't see it fitting in. It sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't work for Hollywood AT ALL!!! And besides, The Twilight Zone > Guardians of the Galaxy. But on the bright side. It's just in California. Orlandos is staying the same (THANK GOD!!), and since the Paris one was a clone of the California one, now the Paris one will actually be unique.

OK. There was something off about Tower of Terror. It seems like they stripped away a lot of the effects. They didn't have the mirror effect, they didn't have the stuff in the hallway, and they didn't even have the music during the dropping, which really does make a difference. Apparently there was a sign telling guests this that I didn't see and nobody bothered to tell me about *ahem ahem*.

I hate to just repeat what everyone else is saying. <a href="http://www.thewrap.com/2016-worst-year-prince-donald-trump-bowie/">But it's true</a>. 2016 is the worst year in a longass time. Even if you exclude the celebrity deaths and the rise of fascism, and only focused on personal sh*t, it'd still be the worst year ever. But sorry to all the people clamoring for 2017. <a href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/312630/shut-up-about-how-bad-2016-is-2017-is-gonna-be-way-worse/">It's not going to get better</a>. So yeah.
