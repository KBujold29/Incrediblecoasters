<center>
Time for us to go to our first real park of the trip!!! Oh, and on the drive there, we passed by this really cool building.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="parkinglot2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well wherever we're going, they have these great solar panels to help power the place and bring shade to your car so you don't physically burn yourself trying to drive away.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! A coaster that isn't a pathetic kiddy credit whoring machine!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainbowmagicland.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep!!! We're here at Rainbow Magicland!!!! Hey Jersey!!! Come to Rainbow Magicland with us!!! We know you want to!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cagliostro.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets first start off with some ERT on Cagliostro!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cagliostro2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Cagliostro is the parks spinning coaster. And since its mostly indoors and in the dark, I didn't know what to expect.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cagliostro3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But the park did give us lights on rides, which is very cool. But the ride itself is fairly lame. It doesn't really do all to much, nor does it really spin a lot. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rainbowmagicland2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well the park is now open and here they are doing their opening dance number which comes with funniest and weirdest park theme songs. Seriously. Listen to it <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZ70HUx396A">here.</a>
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="nutella.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Selling Nutella in your gift shops is totally badass. Other parks, please take notice.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gelato4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And they have Italian Gelato, the stuff that kings eat.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep!!! Its time to get on the star attraction of the park. Shock.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Now we supposed to get ERT on it before the park opened, but it was having some problems. But when it did open up, they still gave us the ERT!!! YAY!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude. SHOCK IS F*CKING AMAZING!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Shock pretty much has everything you want in a good coaster. Shock has it all. The launch is powerful and fast, the big hill provides some nice ejector air, and the non-inverting loop is a crazy element that has both airtime, and great laterals. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And Holy Crap!!! This turn is just insane!!! You WHIP through it at ridicously fast speeds!!!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. You pull quite a lot of G Forces right here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And then we have the final inversion.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You get some seriously wicked hangtime here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Good speed, Great Airtime, Great Hangtime, Insane Laterals, Great Whip. Great ride. 2 thumbs up from Incrediblecoasters. Get on Shock this instant (And thank you Harold for letting get this photo of your on-ride photo).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="polarstreet.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Since this park has no shade and barely any water fountains, this was a very nice sight to see.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for another credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombo2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey Cody!!! Its another Vekoma Roller Skater.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bombo3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only that, but its one of the big models too. I rode the big model now, I just had to fly out to Italy to do it. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bruco.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You have no idea how happy I am to be riding yet another Wacky Worm.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="olandesevolante.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Just one last credit for us to get at Rainbow Magicland.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="olandesevolante2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And yep. It is indeed a Vekoma Mine Train.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="olandesevolante3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Meh, its fun. But can I go back on Shock now?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterfountain2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WATER!!!! I FOUND WATER!!!! ITS A MIRACLE!!!! Now please leave me here for a good 5 minutes.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mystika.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This was a fun drop tower, though I did feel that the brakes were too harsh. Seriously, I've had smoother cliff jumping landings than on this thing.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="huntik.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can someone please explain to me what the hell was going on in that shooting dark ride?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch18.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! The dining options here are fantastic!!! I wish more American Parks had stuff like this for lunch!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yucatanRAINBOWMAGICLAND.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This may very well be one of the best themed water rides I've ever been on.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="yucatanRAINBOWMAGICLAND2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPLOOSH!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="drakkar.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I was impressed with their Shoot-The-Chutes. Lets see how well their rapids ride turns out.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="drakkar2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, from my experience working at Roaring Rapids at SFMM and then riding this, the differences in saftey standards are astounding. First off, the ride has no seatbelts, and EVERYONE is standing up, and nobody cares since its not against the rules.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yes please, I do want to take the bizzare Rainbow Magicland Cat home with me.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="merchandise11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
What the hell are you talking about? Of course this merchandise is family friendly!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="believix.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ok, lets see what the hell this dark ride is all about.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="believix2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, its some sort of weird bizarre Peter Pan sort of knock off. YAY!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="isolavolante.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to get some great ariel shots from the flying island (I already showed you some in the update).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'm pretty sure this was supposed to be a dark ride section, but they didn't have the money to do it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love this Shock shot. Hell, at the time I was making the update, this was my desktop shot.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="shock13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Hang Time!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mall11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Aww. We could've been at the Fashion District instead. Why didn't we go there!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mountain4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we had a great day at Rainbow Magicland, but now we have a long drive out to Rimini.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mountain5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But hey. It was a really great drive that included real nice mountains.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beach3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Beautiful Italian Beaches.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="realcastle.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And I even managed to see a real castle!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rimini.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well, we made it to Rimini!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="beer.jpg" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After a long drive and a great day at Rainbow Magicland, lets finish it off by drinking giant beers and watching everyone else go crazy about Italy winning a soccer, sorry I mean football game.
