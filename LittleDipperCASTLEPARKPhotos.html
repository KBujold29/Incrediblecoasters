For today's review, we'll be reviewing Castle Park's kiddy kiddy coaster. No, not Merlin's Revenge. The really small one. Little Dipper. If you were really whorish, you climbed in the car, the operator pulled down the lap bar, and you're off. You first start off by climbing the lift hill. Which is patheticly small. I mean, come on. The lift hill was about the same size as me. Then you go down the first drop. And suprisingly, it was faster than expected. But yeah. Its just four dips in a row and a turn before you go back through the station and then repeat over and over and over again. I had a lot of fun being an idiot on this ride. Now this ride is currently SBNO, though I did originally hear it was torn down and incorrectly marked it as dead. It may still end up as dead. Don't think so, but it won't matter regardless.
