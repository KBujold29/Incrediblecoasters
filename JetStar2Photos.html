We're here at Lagoon. Today's ride we'll be reviewing for you is Jet Star 2. This ride may not look like much, but trust me. It's WAY crazier than it looks. After getting in the trains and buckling the seatbelts, we're off. Seriously, this ride only has a seatbelt. Oh, and just a fun little fact. No single riders are allowed on this ride. And they don't make any exceptions. So if you have a group of three, you're all going to be sitting together. I hope you're riding with your boyfriend or girlfriend, because you're gonna be spooning on this ride. Anyways, we're spooning and we're off. We head around a turn and that turn turns into a spiral lifthill. So we're just turning and turning and turning as we rise into the sky. Watch us go round like a merry go round. Eventually, we stop turning and have reached the top. We're staring down a drop. It doesn't look that big. So this shouldn't be...BAM!!! We just FLY down that drop. I know we're not really going that fast, but it certainly feels like we're going much faster than we really are. And right at the bottom of that first drop is a turn. A tight turn. And we just SLAM through it. We get pinned to the side with some mean and agressive laterals. And I just love that. We rise out of that tight turn and up an incline, losing some of our speed, but that's OK. It's already been a crazy ride. We head around a curve, going right around the spiral lift hill. It's not an intense and mean curve like at the bottom of the first drop, but don't worry about that. There's plenty more insanity coming soon. We go around that turn and down a small drop. Yeah, it's small. Cliff jumpable. But it really helps us pick up speed. And yeah, we may not going that fast in real life, but it feels like we're FLYING. And then comes the craziest part of the ride. The Helix of Death. And no, I do not mean Fake Helix of Death. I know that when I say true helix of death, I'm generally referring to the Body Toilet Bowl Slides like <a href="BazookaBowlsPhotos.html">Bazooka Bowls</a>. But this is just as insane. So gets the honor of being a true helix of death as well. And yeah. WOW!!!! THIS THING IS INTENSE!!! It just PINS you to the side and rises you up, and you just keep turning and turning. You're getting really close to your spooning buddies right now. Just close your eyes and wait for it all to perside. We eventually go through all that madness and rise up another hill. Yeah, that takes away a lot of our speed. But Geez!!! That helix we just went through was just nuts. We then head down this helix going around the spiral lifthill. Wave goodbye to all those poor suckers who have no idea what they're in for. This helix isn't nearly as intense as the Helix of Death, but it still gives us a lot of laterals. We then head around another banked turn. Just keep going. Keep going and going and going. And BAM!!! We hit the brake run. Take a deep breath. The insanity is now over. It's all over. HOLY SH*T!!! This ride may not look like anything special, but do NOT underestimate this ride. It will kick your ass!!! I know a running joke is that they call it Jet Star 2 because you take a #2 on the ride. And yeah. It's really crazy. Sadly, this ride is becoming really rare. The only clones of this ride are in these tiny little random parks in Poland and Sweden. So definetly make sure you ride this ride when you visit Lagoon. it's a small little coaster that'll really take you on a wild ride. Just make sure you find yourself a spooning buddy.
