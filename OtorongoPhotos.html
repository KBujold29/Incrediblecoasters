We're here at Splashin' Safari, where we'll be reveiwing Otorongo. Now you may not think much of this slide. In fact, you're probably wondering why this got its own review. It just sort of looks like the tube slides in <a href="ShoreBreakPhotos.html">Shore Break</a>. But this slide has one thing most slides don't. AIRTIME!!! Well, at least the one that I did has some. But yeah. That surprised me. You have three options to hoose from here. The turn slide, the drop slide, and another turn slide. They even techncally have names. Otto, Ron, and Go. Aww. That's clever. Go is the one we care about as that's the straight drop one. It's got a little airtime, some good speed, and really caught me off guard. It's a really freaking good slide, and I'm pretty sure the turn ones are also really fun. Considering how this slide probably isn't getting a huge line, you don't want to miss this slide.
