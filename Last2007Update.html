Hey Bob, Now that we painted half of the raven turn, how about we go paint the horseshoe today? But Johnny, If we keep painting random sections of the ride, it won't open on time. Hey Bob, I don't give a sh*t!!! My life sucks!!! My girlfriend just dumped me, My parents are dead and I'm a painter at a freaking Six Flags Park. Besides, It serves them right for stealing this god damn color scheme.

You've probably heard by now that Cody stands up on sit down rollercoasters. So why is he sitting down on the stand up coaster?
