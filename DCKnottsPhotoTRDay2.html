Day 2
</center>
<center>
Gettysberg and Arrival in DC
</center>

<center>
The Days Inn hotel was nice. We then went to Gettysberg to the 
battlefeild. It was cool to pretend to fire the cannons. All of the 
Monuments were cool. Guess how many officers died in the CA monument
Cody? Then we were off to Americas capital DC. We then went up to the
top of the Washington Monument. It's freakin high. More than twice as
high as Goliath! The veiw was cool. Then we went off to the Pentagon
mall. It looked as cool as the Bourse mall, but we didn't have time to 
see it more. Villa Pizza was great for Pizza. I've never seen one in 
California before. I guess CA doesn't like Villa pizza the same way 
it doesn't like Carrabbas. We at least brought a little stupidity 
there. Then we went to the Jefferson Memorial which was cool. It was 
fun. We then saw the Korean, Vietnam and Lincoln memorials where I 
pissed Alisa off! They were cool. We'll have more DC photos tomorrow.
Onto todays photos
