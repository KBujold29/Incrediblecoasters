We're here at Six Flags Great Adventure. Today's ride we'll be traveling back in time to review Rolling Thunder. After getting in the trains, the trains dispatch. We roll around a turn, and begin to head up the lift hill. We then saw the other side of Rolling Thunder. Normally, we would shake our fists at the other side and declare them our enemies, but we're not going to today for two imporant reasons. #1. Rolling Thunder does not exist anymore and we're just here in a flashback. #2. Both of us realize that there is no point to this competition. I mean, look above you. What do you see? That's right. El Toro. Best coaster ever. We can scream and shout at the other side all we want, but in the end, we're both losers for being on Rolling Thunder. The real winners are over on El Toro. So let's just hide our shame and get on with this review. We reach the top and head down the first drop. We gain some speed, but nothing special. We duck underneath the Rolling Thunder hill on El Toro before soaring up into another airtime hill. Though to be fair, that's not an accurate term as there is no airtime here at all. And I mean, at all. We're just CRAWLING at the top. We drop back down and head down a smaller hill. It's all right. But there's still no airtime. We head up and go through a turnaround. And yeah, it's slow and dull at this point. And sadly, there's no sign of it getting exciting any time soon. Dip down, airtimeless hill. Yawn, I'm getting bored just writing this review. Can I please flash back to the present and ride El Toro? Or at least sit around and go back to being lazy in the real world!! We rise up through another hill, except this one has a turn to it as well. So we get some laterals at least. But still no airtime. And now, just four more bunny hops as we head into the final stretch. Let's count how many times there's no airtime. Nope. No airtime on hill #1. Still no airtime on hill #2. Hill #3 dissapoints us again. And finally, hill #4. Drumroll please. NO AIRTIME!!!! We head around a turn and glide straight into the brake run. Ugh. So glad that it's over. I constantly joked around about how I was amazed that Rolling Thunder could survive with El Toro, one of the best wooden coasters ever right above it, and sure enough, the park bulldozed the ride and it exists no more. I just hope Six Flags is smart with the space now freed up from Rolling Thunder. I keep hearing that they want to turn the space with Rolling Thunder into a walkway. Really? I'm not one to scream fill every corner of the park with something. But come on. A pathway. What a waste of space.
