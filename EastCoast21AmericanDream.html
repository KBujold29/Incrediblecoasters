I've seen the reviews this place has gotten. I don't think "LOVE" is the word that seems to resonate with all the other critics.
</center>
	 
 <p>

<img src="animalscooter.JPG" width="640" height="480">

<center>
Question. Has anyone ever thought about making an ATV, only make it look like one of those soft cuddly mall animals? I would LOVE to ride one of these and make them go 60 mph over rough and rugged terrain.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="americandream.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So yeah. We're here at American Dream, which is another one of those GIANT-ASS MALLS, on par with Mall of America, and some of the other mega-malls that have a theme park inside.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="americandream2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So this place had a ROUGH opening. They opened up right at the start of 2020, RIGHT BEFORE everything closed due to COVID. I've seen countless people comparing this place to Hard Rock Park (which is part of the reason we rushed to get here). And even now, this place feels like it should be busier than it is.

This place got so screwed over by COVID that the Youtube Series "Abandoned" (Interesting concept) did a video on American Dream being abandoned and failing. Which...Happy to see that the park is NOT abandoned, but yeah. They really are struggling.

So for lunch, while everyone else got....some random Fast Food place that I don't remember and had no interest in, I decided to stop over at the Philly Cheesesteak place since....Cheesesteaks are delicous. And we are pretty close to Philadelphia. Hopefully that improves the quality. Needless to say, I was dissapointed and not impressed.

But of course, we didn't come here to go see a big mall. I can do a normal mall back home. No, we came for the theme park inside.

Don't worry. You'll have fun at Nickelodeon Universe! The Nickelodeon characters promise! And would they ever lie to you?

Aww. Even the Pet Kennel is Nickelodeon themed (If that's not the kennel, it should be lol).

<img src="nickelodeonuniverseNJ2.JPG" width="640" height="480">

All right. So this place has been getting A LOT of complaints and is getting a reputation on par with La Ronde and Mt. Olympus from many other enthusiasts. And while I don't think that that's fair as I had a really fun time here and didn't have most of the issues that other enthusiasts seemed to have. The one thing I have heard people complain about and TOTALLY agree with are the ticket pricing. GOD DAMN!!! I get that COVID REALLY f*cked them over, and they need to turn a profit. But the prices that they're charging for here are NOT WORTH IT!!! JESUS CHRIST!!! They (at least in June 2021 when we went) charge an arm and a leg here! Part of me feels that they'd make more money by lowering prices so that more people would come! Then again, Hard Rock Park did that and....that didn't work out. And I'm saying this as someone who WANTS them to succeed.

I heard there was a big theme park in America I hadn't been to yet. I had to change that (Seriously, at this point, I think the biggest place I still need in the US is f*cking Darien Lake. And I'm not in a hurry to get there).

Ooh! I want to ride the Log Log Log Ride. It fills me with such Happy Happy Joy Joy (OMG! A Ren & Stimpy Log Flume that constantly plays the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fQGPZTECYs">Log Song</a>! That would be SO COOL!!! Build it American Dream! Seriously! #JustDoIt).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bootsbananaswing.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Yep. This is why we came to American Dream. One of the best flat rides ever. It's so going in our Top 10 Flat Rides List. =P 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sandysblastingbronco.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Nah, but there's something actually worth looking foreward to.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sandysblastingbronco2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So Sandy's Blasting Bronco is this weird sort of funky contraption from Intamin, and I'm happy to report that this thing KICKED ASS!!!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sandysblastingbronco5.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
It gives a fun forceful ride going foreward, kind of like a Sky Rocket in some ways. But then it takes it up a notch and does it all backwards. And....yeah. Doing it all backwards just makes for some really cool trippy disorienting fun. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sandysblastingbronco4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
This thing takes up a super small footprint, and I imagine that it's pretty cheap to build these. So....I really hope some clones of this thing pop up cause I REALLY was happy with this ride. One of the bigger surprises of the trip to be honest.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="lockers.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
*Sigh* Come on American Dream. Stop it with the Zipper Intolerance.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="shredder.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Next up, we have Shredder.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="shredder2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So this is the park's spinning coaster. And if you can't tell, this isn't just the standard Gerstlauer Spinning Coaster with a new name. It actually has a custom layout, which makes this quite a few steps above the other Spinning Coasters. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="shredder3.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I'm REALLY happy to report that this thing spun like crazy. Yeah, if you're wanting a more mild spinning coaster, this isn't gonna be it for you. Maybe we just got lucky on our ride.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="shredder5.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
But on top of that, the ride itself is just really long and has a really nice layout.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="shredder4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Throw in a bunch of interaction with TMNT Shellraiser, and you have one of the best spinning coasters. #5 (Just behind Winjas, Tornado @ Bakken, Geiko Live Coaster @ Tokyo Joypolis, and Spin Runway @ Yomiuriland). Best Spinning Coaster in America (This excludes Time Traveler since....I may not have gotten there yet, but come on. Overdue to get back to Silver Dollar City)! YAY!!!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So yeah. Shellraiser is having some difficulties, so....let's get this out of the way.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
THAT'S THE CARS YOU RIDE IN!!? ARE YOU F*CKING SERIOUS!!?

 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak3.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I have seen legitimate kiddy coasters with more comfortable trains and legroom. This has no excuse. Ugh.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Putting the HORRIBLE trains aside, this is the parks family cruiser coaster. It's basically their version of Jaguar or Pepsi Orange Streak.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak5.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Well, aside from the HORRIBLE trains, another advantage those two have over this ride is that it's surprisingly short. Yeah. I was really surprised at just how quickly this ride was over. I get that it's inside a mall. But....so is Pepsi Orange Streak. I get that they do double-laps to compensate for the short length, but....yeah. Very dissapointed in Nickelodeon Slime Streak. It really felt more like a kiddy coaster than I was expecting (It's not, but it's closer to one than I was expecting).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nickelodeonslimestreak6.jpg" width="853" height="480">
</center>
<center>
But hey. At least you get a great view of everything in Nickelodeon Universe. That's a plus....I guess. Thumbs down.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Ooh! Shellraiser opened up. Time to get on that.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser7.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So while this is the star attraction of the park (though honestly, Sandy's Blasting Bronco gives it a run for its money). But unlike everyone else, this wasn't too unique as this is a clone of Takabisha @ <a href="Japan18FujiQ.html">Fuji-Q Highlands</a>.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
One difference is that the pre-launch section that's in the dark on Takabisha, you can clearly see that part of the ride on Shellraiser. It's not hidden at all.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser3.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
While it is cool to get pictures of this part of the ride....yeah. It's much better in the dark.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser5.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Bro! Can you guys help us! Now we've got some theme park in Japan claiming we stole their roller coaster. Can you help us prove that that's total bogus man!?

 <p>
<center>
<img src="aangsairgliders.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
OK. Time to get on some of the flat rides. I think I've seen this ride before.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="aangsairgliders2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
NICE!!! Their version of Aang's Gliders is an Air Race! This is SO much better than the glider rides I was imagining this to be. =) 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="kraangprimepandemonium.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Sweet! I FINALLY found another version of Spin Cycle found at <a href="SLTSilverwood17.html">Silverwood</a>. Thanks for adding this American Dream. They really are a crazy flat ride.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skylinescream.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Quit faking it Arnold. S&S Drop Towers do NOT provide that much airtime.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="skylinescream2.JPG" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
The drop tower here....I'm torn on. On the one hand, you get GREAT NYC views, and it runs a program similar to Superman: Tower of Power @ SFOT. On the other hand, the launches and weaks somehow feel even weaker than a standard S&S Tower. It feels a little.....frog hoppy, if you get what I mean.

 <p>

<img src="timmyshalfpipehavoc.JPG" width="640" height="480">

</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="timmyshalfpipehavoc2.JPG" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
*Sigh* This was closed all day. I know another complaint people have with this place is that way too many rides are closed. And....I've seen some reports where yeah. Totally true. And even with our visit, we can't say everything was open due to this. And yeah. It's a bummer since Half-Pipes are really fun. But I guess I'll just have to come back for this. At least it wasn't Shellraiser or Sandy's Blasting Bronco.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sandysblastingbronco3.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Hell yes! I want more rides on Sandy's Blasting Bronco! That little squirrel sure knows her sh*t.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="jimmyneutronsatomsmasher3.JPG" width="640" height="480">

And of course, Scott and I managed to get this thing flipping like crazy since....we like it that way.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="invaderzimsflipandspinofdoom.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Ooh. With all the crazy flat rides they've presented so far, I'm looking foreward to seeing what a Flip and Spin of Doom is. 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="invaderzimsflipandspinofdoom2.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So these are basically bumper cars with the ability to flip. Super cool idea, but unfortunately, these seem to be closed. And closed long-term. Please fix this as this ride seems really cool.

<img src="tmntshellraiser8.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Yeah. We gotta get more rides on TMNT Shellraiser. It still is the 2nd (or 3rd I guess since I slightly prefer Takabisha, but they're clones, and so close that I'm calling it a draw).
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tmntshellraiser4.JPG" width="480" height="640">
</center>
<center>
The view on this is surprisingly on par with Takabisha. I know Takabisha is right by Mt. Fuji. But thanks to all the windows, you get a really good view of NYC at the top of the lifthill. And the constant interaction with Shredder is cool.

Now we really were considering doing this at one point since....it really does look like a kickass water park. But....the price was just too much. Maybe next time if the price drops. But we'll find other stuff to do.

So Scott & Steve decided to do some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2DDqW8G8Q0&t=61s">exploding Mini-Golf</a>, and while that does sound fun, AJ & I had a much better idea instead.

<img src="bigsnow.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Yep. We decided to go skiing. Skiing in June in New Jersey. Is it absurd? Yes. But god damn it! It's fun!
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bigsnow2.jpg" width="788" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Quick little tip. If you plan on going skiing.....actually ski. We saw some random guy having trouble getting on the ski lift, then refuse to just go down for the longest time. He then tried, repeatedly fell on his face, before eventually walking down the hill halfway. Sorry dude, but that's hilarious. Come on, if I can do it, someone with NO skiing training and had only done it ONCE prior to today, then so can you. =P 
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bigsnow3.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So I had gone skiing <a href="LakeTahoeSkiingTrip2008.html">once before</a>, but that was 12.5 years ago. And I remember being the only person in my family who enjoyed skiing. So what are my thoughts on it as an adult?
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="bigsnow4.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
I really liked it. I honestly feel like I probably could advance up to intermediate blue square runs if this was a full skiing trip. However, for as much as I enjoyed this, I won't be doing a ski trip any time soon for one simple reason. Money. Skiing is f*cking expensive. And I struggle enough doing these trips, let alone the other fun expensive hobbies and tastes I have. Throw on top of that more bills and adult bullsh*t combined with rampant price-gouging....I mean inflation, and yeah. I can't do a ski trip. If you see a ski trip update on Incrediblecoasters, that's a low-key sign that I'm rich now most likely.
