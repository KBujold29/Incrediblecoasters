Today is the one day of the year we go to Hurricane Harbor.

What a better way to start the day by getting your ass kicked on Bamboo Racer.

<center>
Although Pacific Spin is better than Tornado,...
<center>

<p>

<center>
Tornado is still fun and worth riding when theres a short ride.

Since we conquered Hurricane Harbor, We went to Magic Mtn. BTW, When did they add these signs? They don't seem very Incrediblecoastersfriendly.

The best way to have a good ride on Goliath is to call your friends on the rides.
<center>

<p>
<center>

</center>
<center>
On second thought, don't call your friends on Goliath. You don't want to break the ride like we did. You call always try calling your friends on Riddlers though.

This is Scream. Everything about Scream is Screaminly awsome!
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream25.jpg">
</center>
<center>
Although I never hear any Screaming on Scream. All I hear is a purdy B&M roar.
<center>

<p>
<center>
<img src="scream26.jpg">
</center>
<center>
But who cares about that. This is a SCREAMING corkscrew on the SCREAMING SCREAM!!!!!!
<center>

<center>
Riddlers Revenge may not be SCREAMINGLY awsome, but its got some nice speed and other forces.
<center>

<center>
No, you're not seeing things, Tatsu does NOT fold into flying position on the ride anymore. Now they turned it into an Inverted coaster.
<center>

DejaVu is getting rougher. I felt a good smack in the head in on the Cobra Roll.

Viper hates us so much that it gives you chestbanging. Thats what Viper does when people brush their teeth on rollercoasters.
