All right. Its time for our first Knotts visit of 2013 and sadly, Montezooma's Revenge was down. Windseeker, don't care about that. But DAMMIT!!! NOT MONTEZOOMA!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="xcelerator58.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride is awesome. Definetly one of the best in the country.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But while Xcelerator is awesome, we're here to focus on other things since Knotts got for 2013. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
For instance, they gave Timber Mtn Log Ride a makeover.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'll just say this right now. The Timber Mtn Log Ride Makeover KICKED SOME SERIOUS ASS!!!!! I LOVED IT!!!! =D
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boardwalkKBF.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But Knotts didn't just get a makeover for Timber Mtn Log Ride. They also completely re-did the Boardwalk and added three new rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfgliders.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
First off, Knotts ended up getting Flyers!!!! Sweet!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfgliders2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude, these types of rides are completely awesome. Why don't more parks get Flyers?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="surfgliders3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Take note: When riding Flyers, be sure to ride sideways.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="pacificscrambler.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh hello Wilderness Scrambler. Good to see you again. Yeah, they just recycled Wilderness Scrambler and stuck it as one of the new rides. How many times has that Scrambler been moved now?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riptide12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And finally, the third new ride is a brand spanking new Top Spin named Riptide. No, wait a minute...thats been there for a while. Dammit!!!! What's that third new Boardwalk ride!!? I forgot!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="boomerang19.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm...well they repainted Boomerang. I like the look of it, but can you guys just repaint Boomerang to its original blue colors it had in the 90s? But hey. At least now it matches my work uniform. But what's that third ride dammit!!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Knotts ended up getting a Wild Mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Nice name you gave your Wild Mouse. Its almost as good as your replacement name for Top Gun (Yes, I still call those rides Top Gun and No, I don't plan on adapting the (not new anymore) name anytime soon).
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Coast Rider is one of those big drop Wild Mouse.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I gotta be honest. I'm still kind of bitter about this ride replacing Perilous Plunge for this ride. And its not that they got rid of something intense for something family oriented, its that they got rid of something unique for something as common in theme parks as Starbucks is to the rest of the world. Plus, Perilous Plunge was not only awesome, but it also served as a crucial role that California DESPERATELY NEEDED and now California now lacks anything with Ejector Air. I don't want to have to either fly 1000 miles north to Vancouver to get my ejector air fix from Coaster or fly 3000 miles across the country to get it from El Toro. We need something like that here BADLY and Perilous Plunge was the closest thing we had and now its gone. I know that Knotts was aiming for the family market and wanted a family coaster. I understand, but I think something like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxqtfYAF2h8">this</a> would've been better, or even better, something like <a href="http://www.incrediblecoasters.com/woodenwarrior10.JPG">this</a> which is not only a family ride, but would also fill the airtime void in California.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider5.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Now keep in mind, this is just me talking from a purely selfish point of view. I certainly want Knotts to be successful and if they're doing well with an ordinary "There's now 3 of these god damn things in Southern California now!!!" Wild Mouse, then I'm happy that others like it and that Knotts is doing well from it. I just want my ejector air back. Thats all. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coastrider6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All in all, you're just another credit for my count.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bigfootrapids8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Get out of my way!!! I know how to turn on Pumps. I'll have Bigfoot Rapids flowing in no time.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ponyexpress16.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Considering that "PONY EXPRESS IS THE BEST RIDE EVER!!!!!!!", we had to give it a courtesy ride.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ponyexpress17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"ANYONE WHO DOESN'T LIKE THIS RIDE IS A PUSSY!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ghostriderline5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is it me or did Ghostrider seem fairly smooth today?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mrsknottschicken9.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we had to eat Mrs. Knotts for lunch.
</center>


<p>
<center>
  <img src="mrsknottschicken10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Mmm. Bacon Tile Strips. *drool*
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mrsknottschicken11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh, and just so you know. Mrs. Knotts has a secret room that is still surviving from the 1930s.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="rooster2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You must beware of man, for he might lead you to the hell known as Mrs. Knotts Chicken Dinner Resteraunt.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wagonshow.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Considering how many times I've been to Knotts and still haven't seen the Wagon Show, I decided to give it a watch.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wagonshow2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Sweet!!! We got our own Stagecoach.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wagonshow3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"What are you folks doing!!? You folks from the NSA working for the Obama Administration? Get the hell outta my here town!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="wagonshow4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was a fun show, but nothing mind blowing or amazingly spectacular. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverbullet45.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Up next, Silver Bullet.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverbullet46.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Silver Bullet from the Wagon Show.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="silverbullet47.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This ride only gets better with age. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride13.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Considering how good the Timber Mtn Log Ride now is, we decided to get some more rides on it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride14.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
SPLOOSH!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="timbermtnlogride15.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WEE!!!! I'M GONNA MARATHON THIS THING!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stagecoach2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of things I've never done at Knotts before, I've never done the Stagecoach before. So lets give that a whirl.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stagecoach3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Seriously? These are the people we're doing this for?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="stagecoach4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It was fun, I just wish they allowed prefered seating. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="steakbrands.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I love this idea. I gotta get some of these and start branding my steaks.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="guns6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You have to ask yourself "Do I feel lucky?" Do ya punk?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="liscence2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Good job dipsh*ts. You just revealed the location of Springfield.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="guns7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Somewhere out there, the NRA/Gun Manufacters (same thing really) are losing their sh*t over this since fake guns don't turn a profit for them.
</center>

Because even though you're an adult, we don't trust you until you reach this arbitrary age. Welcome to America. =)

<p>

  <img src="badge.JPG" width="640" height="480" />

<center>
Quit ruining my fun!!! ='(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign281.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
You clearly haven't met Cliff yet.
</center>

<p>

  <img src="waterpump.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Keep pumping William. You gotta pay off your park ticket somehow.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandia3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After our fun at Knotts, we decided to go out and have some fun. So why not take a last minute trip to Scandia!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer20.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we came here for one reason.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
MORE RIDES ON THE SCANDIA SCREAMER!!!! YAY!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer22.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Can I just remind you again that this is one of the <a href="Top10UnderratedCoasters.html">most underrated coasters ever</a>?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer23.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"How can a ride so small be so powerful?"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="thorshammer2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look Knotts!! We don't have to pay for this Screamin Swing. =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="littledipperSCANDIA6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh crap. All the creepy coaster people are back to try and destroy the Little Dipper lift hill motor.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cliffjumper7.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
And of course, we have to ride the drop tower themed to us while we're here.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cliffjumper8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
New for Cliff Jumper this year. Seat belts!!! Best 2013 addition ever!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer24.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Scandia Screamer from Cliff Jumper.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cliffjumper9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Heu, it may not be nearly as pants-sh*tting terrifying as jumping the 70 ftr, but its still a lot of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cliffjumper10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WEE!!! CLIFF JUMP!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gravitron3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hell Yes!!! We're gonna have another Gravitron Party!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gravitron4.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Eh, this year, they're playing the Backstreet Boys. Not my favorite band, but whatever. They're no Smash Mouth, but they're tolerable.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gravitron5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
OH DEAR GOD!!! They switched artists and are now playing *gasp* One Direction *barfs all over the Gravitron* !!!!! GET ME OUT OF HERE!!! GET ME OUT!!!! THIS IS TORTURE!!!! Backstreet Boys were fine, THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!! THE LOWEST OF THE LOWEST!!! THE BOTTOM OF THE CRAPPY TODAY MUSIC TOTEM POLE (And thats saying a lot)!!!!!! Seriously, with the exception of a certain Eunuch from Canada whom I don't want to name because naming him will contribute to his non-deserving fame, they are the absolute WORST group I have ever heard. In fact, I'm gonna go download some Backstreet Boys music now because I suddenly really appreciate and like them now when forced to compare them to this aborted atrocity of perverted sound pollution.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer25.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ah Crap!!! Scandia Screamer is gonna kick my ass!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="scandiascreamer26.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yep, Scandia Screamer kicked my ass and I loved it. If you live in Southern California and haven't ridden this, RIDE IT NOW!!! This was my 3rd visit to Scandia just to ride this thing and I know I'll be doing a 4th visit sometime soon. =)
