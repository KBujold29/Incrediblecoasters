Joining Goliath and Batman in the Shiney Category would be the two tube slides from Black Snake Summit. Too bad you won't be able to appreciate it's new shininess since it's dark inside there.

To Cody's frustration, Goliath got stuck on the mid course brakes, pushing back our Goliath Filming Session to later this afternoon.
</center>

"Hey Bob, Is that Batman the ride?" "Of course not Lou. Batman the Ride is a grey roller coaster and this strange new roller coaster is blue." "But Bob, what if they just repainted it?" "You Dumbass! That's impossible!! You know it's impossible to repaint a roller coaster. They must have completely demolished Batman the Ride, and then constructed this strange new roller coaster within the past two months."
</center>

Warning. Blue forces can be found on this ride.

</center>
<center>
Fun Fact. Batman the Ride was actually repainted with the blood of Smurfs.
</center>

<center>
GOLIATH VS COLLOSUS!!!! FIGHT!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="collosus37.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>

</center>

<center>
Up next would be Riddlers Revenge.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="riddlersrevenge85.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Riddlers was running really slow today. Now normally, this is a bad thing, but Slow Riddlers was actually really awesome. You get a sh*tload of hangtime in the inversions and you can really feel the banking in the turns,
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
We ended up getting 8 rides on Terminator without having to leave the train once!!! It was awesome.
</center>

<p>

</center>

Even Tatsu ended up with a walk on wait.
</center>

<center>
It's kind of like Night ERT at Westcoast Bash.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goliath67.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
And we finally ended the day with a Shiney Goliath Marathon. Overall, I got a lot of shots and rides today. It was a sparkle of fun in this month of difficult finals, false accusations, and scary threats.
