</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. One thing I forgot to mention on this trip. Yep. More Video Camera problems. It turns out that my charger is a peice of sh*t and no longer works. So I was really worried about getting footage. I was really worried about not being able to film. I tried charging it, but that didn't really work as it died at Mirabilandia, so I barely got any footage. (Turns out that I drained my battery as apparently my camera turned on during Katun ERT and was on until it just died.) But luckily, Robb had a solution. It charged when connected to his USB Cable. So he lent it to me for the trip. Once again, thank you so much.

  <img src="coke4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! They're passing out free Coke Zero Samples!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coke5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, they may be tiny and it may be Coke Zero, but in Europe where I'm dehydrated all the time, I don't care!!! I drank about like 10 of these things!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="car8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Does that count as a credit?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tunnel4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
After our day at Movieland Studios, we had two day tickets to Gardaland and the park was open till 11:00, so we decided to just hang out and get some stuff done.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gardaland.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh!!! I see a roller coaster!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gardaland2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Welcome to Gardaland!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Of course we're gonna hit this up first.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. So this was my first B&M Wingrider. What did I think?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, I was impressed. I was expecting a forceless ride. And while its not insane, its just a ton of fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Enjoy your ride on Raptor!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
No need for Fastpass tonight. It looks like we're gonna be fine.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluetornado.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Lets just get this out of the way as quickly as possible.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluetornado2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is no ordinary SLC. This one has the BONUS HELIX!!!!!!! =)
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="bluetornado3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Though in all seriousness, it wasn't that bad.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ashtray.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
One more thing to not if you're going to Europe. Everyone smokes here. There are no smoking regulations, so everyones smoking in the park, in the lines, everywhere. 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mammut.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Damn. We're on a roll with Vekoma Rides tonight.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mammut2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. This was a really good mine train. And well themed as well.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacevertigo.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Is that seriously the size of their drop tower?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacevertigo2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on Gardaland!!!! This is puny!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacevertigo3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Well at least it has a cool themed line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="iceage4D.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to see the Ice Age show. It was cool, though it would've been better if I spoke Italian. For instance, I had no clue that the female wooly mammoth was pregnant until she went into labor and I was like "It looks like..." Boom. Baby Wooly Mammoth.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ramses.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We decided to check out their shooting dark ride. Ramses.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ramses2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This dark ride is awesome. Its like Mummy meets Terminator.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ramses3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Trippy.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mask.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WHO MISSED THE BUS!!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterfountain4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
JACKPOT!!! I HIT THE F*CKING JACKPOT!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gardaland3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. We're up nice and early the next morning. For its time for...
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND6.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
ERT ON RAPTOR!!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND7.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its no Kumba or anything, but its a ton of fun. Its very fun and very floaty with lots of hangtime. It almost reminds me of Hydra @ Dorney Park in a way, except with much better theming and it actually gets you more wet than the water rides.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND8.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Kick the sky!!!! Oops, wrong Raptor. Sorry Cedar Point.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Honestly, my only problem with this ride are the restraints. I was expecting just a rubber vest similar to that on Tatsu. But these things keep stapling you in, never giving you a chance to breathe. I really hope that this was just a bug in the design and that they fixed it for all the 2012 Wing Riders.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sequoiaadventure.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. We also have ERT on Sequoia Adventure.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sequoiaadventure2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Umm, what exactly does this ride do?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sequoiaadventure3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh joy. That looks so thrilling.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sequoiaadventure4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It wouldn't even that bad if it weren't for all the trim brakes that make it crawl.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sequoiaadventure5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, at least its a credit.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="keychain.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. And Gardaland gave us all these personalized key chains. Grazi Gardaland!!! Grazi!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fugadaatlantide.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thank you Fastpass!!!! Good bye Line!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fugadaatlantide2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its a fun water ride, but yeah. Its a water ride. NOT A CREDIT!!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="monorotaia.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Lets take a ride on their Monorail.
</center>
<p>
<center>
  <img src="monorotaia2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Look at all the pretty rights.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="gardaland4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
I'm confused. Where am I again?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magichouse.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. They have a Vekoma Mad House in the kids area.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magichouse2.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
These things are all over Europe.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="fountain9.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. Nice looking kids area.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="picture27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This is so politically correct. I'm sure that all those kids are proper representations of their cultures.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lunch21.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time for lunch. And yeah, they have a great selection at Gardaland. Oh, time for another America vs Europe Comparison. FANTA IS SO MUCH BETTER IN EUROPE!!! Seriously, American Fanta tastes like crap now. I refuse to drink it till I go back to Europe or somewhere else in the world. Now everyones told me that its because they use real sugar instead of High Fructose Corn Syrup. And yeah, I'm sure they do that and that helps. But thats not just it. Because its a MUCH bigger difference than that. Its much bigger than when they do Pepsi and Mountain Dew Throwbacks and use real sugar. I think someone once said that they use real orange juice in European Fanta. Now that I believe since it tastes so much orangier than in America.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ortobrucotour.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for their kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ortobrucotour2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
If you thought that this was just an ordinary Wacky Worm, you'd be mistaken.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ortobrucotour3.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Its actually a lot of fun and has a great layout. Great for a kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ortobrucotour.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Time for their kiddy coaster.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magicmountain.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Just one last credit for me to get at Gardaland. Magic Mountain. And its properly themed to SFMM, with the ads in the station.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magicmountain2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. At least they're upselling a great product.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magicmountain3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Kevin!!! What the hell are you doing!!!? Get in uniform and report to Roaring Rapids immedietly!!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="magicmountain4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Definetly one of the better Loopscrews. Not too rough and actually had some decent airtime. I actually enjoyed it.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="cow2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey David!!! It's ok to eat me!!! I promise I won't mind!!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="mime.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey!!! Go annoy someone else today!!!"
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="coloradoboat.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. This wasn't one of the greatest log flumes or anything. But I had fun.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spongebob4D.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Um, yeah. This Spongebob Simulator was rough as hell.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND10.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Lets take another ride on Raptor. Because hey. Why not!!!!?
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND13.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="waterfountain5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
This water fountain sucks. Its overcrowded, has a long line, the stream is super weak, so it takes forever to drink, add that with the overcrowded, and it'll take you up to 20 minutes to get a drink of water. >=(
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="sign238.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Keep him alive so we can torture him. *evil laugh*
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="prezzemoloslabyrinth.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. We did the hedge maze. Cause hey!!! Why not!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="prezzemoloslabyrinth2.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
It can't be too hard.
</center

><p>
<center>
  <img src="prezzemoloslabyrinth3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Thanks for the ever-so-helpful advice. *rolls eyes*
</center


><p>
<center>
  <img src="prezzemoloslabyrinth4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
We all made it out. Well, except for Colin who is a F*CKING CHEATER!!!!!! 
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="junglerapids.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey, these are fun and they have a nice theme, but they're not gonna help you escape the Italian heat.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icorsari.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
All right. Time to check out the parks Pirates of the Carribean knock off, Icorsari.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icorsari2.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Dude!!! This thing was awesome!!! It was almost better than the real Pirates of the Carribean in some ways!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icorsari3.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey look!!! Another totally family friendly moment to share with everyone!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="icorsari4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. It goes under the sea. Its very strange in that way.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ramses5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Speaking of really strange dark rides, lets hit up Ramses again!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ramses4.jpeg" width="720" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Grr!!! I'm the Mummy Terminator!!! I'm from the past but also from the future!!! So I guess that means I'm from the present I guess!!! Gimme a Pizza Party!!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="lights4.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Ooh. Look at the pretty lights.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacevertigo4.JPG" width="480" height="640" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. Space Vertigo has a funky fast pass door.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="spacevertigo5.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Come on Gardaland. This ride is so small that its nearly cliff jumpable!!! You can totally make it bigger!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND11.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hey. We may have used up all our Raptor Fastpasses, but we can still get on thanks to the Single Riders Line.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="raptorGARDALAND12.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Yeah. I'm pretty sure that night rides on Raptor is the best way to close out my fantastic visit to Gardaland and Italy in general. Switzerland & Walygator Photos will be posted soon.
