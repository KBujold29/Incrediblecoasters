We're here at Splashin' Safari, and we're here to ride the parks family raft ride, Zoombabwe. However, this family raft ride, isn't exactly a family water slide. I mean, yeah. Families can enjoy it together. You can be a family of thrill seekers, and then your family is badass! But you know what I mean, Zoombabwe is more thrilling than your average family raft ride (Hell, most don't even get their own review). In fact, when it first opened up, it was the biggest family raft ride in the world. I'm not sure what beat it, but now I'm interested in it. So yeah. Less talking, more sliding. We climb up the stairs, get the tube at the top, hop in, and start to slide on down. We go around a turn, down a small drop. So far, not much is going on. And then we repeat. Turn, small drop, turn small drop. However, with each small drop, we get faster and faster. And the faster we go, the harsher those turns go. So by the end of the slide, you're really going around those turns and getting some decent laterals. Especially towards the end of the ride, we see...these weird things in the slide. They look like a mix between aliens and those Tiki Heads. That's great. We eventually get spit out and back into the pool. It's a fun ride, and something that you totally should check out if visiting Splashin' Safari.
