Six Flags St. Louis is an interesting Six Flags park. Now just for a little history, Six Flags St. Louis was one of the original Six Flags Parks. Just an interesting little fact. Anyways, Six Flags St. Louis is an interesting Six Flags park. Umm, the most I really have to say about this park is that it's really average. Not too much really stood out in the park. Now this is both good and bad. It's bad since there's nothing really amazing to say about it. There's no Top 10 coasters, no record breaking rides, or anything like that. However, what's really good about that, is that there's nothing bad about it. Seriously. I can't think of any negative qualities in the park. Nothing in the park bugged me. Now if you've read all my updates, you'll know that there are many things that many parks have that bug me, including parks that I really like and rate quite highly. So it's really nice to have a park that has no things that bug me, whether its a horrible peice of sh*t ride, horrible employees working in the park, or stupid rules that make absolutely no sense, I found nothing to be wrong with this park. Oh wait, I forgot about Ninja. Ok, they've got a total peice of sh*t in the park, but really. That's it. And when your worst quality is a sh*tty ride, you don't have many problems to begin with. So yeah. Six Flags St. Louis is definetly a very average theme park. It's got some good coasters, and even some nice little quirks and qualities that seperate Six Flags St. Louis from other Six Flags parks. So while you won't walk away from Six Flags St. Louis screaming "OMG!!! THIS IS THE GREATEST THEME PARK I'VE EVER BEEN TO IN MY LIFE!!!!!!!!", it's still a really nice park. Definetly check it out if you're ever in the area.

Here are the reviews of all the Flat Rides at Six Flags St. Louis. Well first off, they've got Superman Tower of Power. This is the parks Intamin 2nd Generation Tower and is one of the few things that actually got saved from Six Flags Astro World. That alone makes the ride pretty cool. Though, it's pretty much impossible to not enjoy a 2nd Generation Tower. So yeah. This is a really fun ride and is a great edition to Six Flags St. Louis. Now if there's another flat ride that needs to be brought up when talking about Six Flags St. Louis, it's Excalibur. This the parks Evolution. Now these are really interesting and fun rides. In case you don't know, you basically flip upsidedown and spin as you move around. So yeah. That is really awesome. And it's not only awesome, but its also actually fairly rare. The evolution never really took off as a flat ride. So these rides aren't exactly common. While they're not so rare that they're nearly impossible to find, they certainly aren't popular enough. Those are the only two flat rides I rode, but nothing else seems spectacular anyway. The parks other flat rides include a starflyer, an enterprise, a falling star, a pirate ship, some chairswings, a scrambler, some bumper cars, a car ride, a giant ferris wheel, a carousel, and a train.

Intamin 2nd Generations are always fun. Especially when they were saved from becoming scrap metal.

Dear parks, please build more Evolutions. They're a really fun flat ride.

What? A Dark Ride in a Six Flags Park!!? Someone call Penn & Teller because that's gotta be bullsh*t!!! Well, nope. Six Flags St. Louis is one of the few Six Flags park to actually have a dark ride. And when we say dark ride, we don't mean crappy simulator or Zombie style dark ride. This is a really fun and legit shooting dark ride. It's called Scooby Doo's Ghostblasters. And yeah. It's your typical shooting dark ride. Which is always fun. But this Scooby Doo shooting dark ride is actually different from the other Scooby Doo shooting dark ride as this one actually doubles as a boat ride. It's a haunted houseboat or something like in a haunted swamp. This makes it more interesting as now you have a haunted swamp, which is more interesting than the typical haunted house. And on top of that, it's a great way to beat the insanely hot St. Louis heat. Definetly check it out.

Now I will say this. The Water Ride collection at Six Flags St. Louis isn't really anything special. I rode their log flume, and trust me. It was one of my least favorite log flumes. It never really went anywhere, it wasn't in any shade, and the drop was really small. Oh, and the park also has a river rapids ride and a Tidal Wave style shoot the chutes ride. So yeah. Nothing special, but when it's 112 degrees, that doesn't matter as long as you get wet. So yeah. Nothing special, but it gets the job done.

Yep, Six Flags St. Louis does indeed have a water park, and no. I did not visit. On the one hand, I would recommend going there because its f*cking 112 degrees in Six Flags St. Louis!!! But on the other hand, everyone else probably has this idea and the water park would be extremely crowded because of it. So...eh. Go at your own risk. Not sure what kind of slides they have, but I'm sure that they're fun.

Like most parks in the Six Flags chain, Six Flags St. Louis has nothing spectacular when it comes to its dining options. Mostly what they serve in the park is typical amusement park crap. Pizza, hot dogs, burgers, yeah. The usual. Seen it a million times, eaten it a billion times. While not bad, it's also nothing special. So yeah. Nothing terrible, but you're not going to write home about how good the food is at Six Flags St. Louis. If you did, you're suffering from heat stroke and have mistaken Six Flags St. Louis for Silver Dollar City.

Here are the reviews of all the other stuff at Six Flags St. Louis. Now as for theming, the park has none whatsoever. I know its a Six Flags park and Six Flags parks don't have theming, but even for a Six Flags park, theming was pretty low. As for natural setting, it was mostly set in the woods right along some major freeway that Missouri locals will call me an idiot for not knowing (Hey, I'm from Southern California. Cut me some slack). As for other stuff to do, I'm really not sure. I don't know of any shows or anything. Perhaps people from St. Louis and have this as their home park can fill me in. But as far as I'm concerned, there's no alternative activities at Six Flags St. Louis.

<font color="#00FF00">
Six Flags St. Louis is a very nice Six Flags park with some really good coasters like Mr. Freeze and American Thunder, and just a lot of other fun rides like Excalibur, and the Scooby Doo Shooting Dark Ride. So yeah. Nothing really too insane or crazy that you would need to write home about, but it's got a really nice balance of coasters, flats, water rides, dark rides, and other fun stuff. Could you visit better parks? Absolutely, but you could also visit much worse parks. And Six Flags St. Louis has a lot of fun to offer. Definetly check it out if you're ever in the St. Louis Area (Oh, and visit the City Museum as well).
