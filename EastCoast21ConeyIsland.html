All right. Today is our Coney Island day in New York City. But that's not until the afternoon. So we've gotta come up with something fun to do in the morning.

So while Scott & Steve checked out the Museum of Modern Art, AJ & I decided to do the Natural History Museum.

This is something that really appeals to my nerdy side. There are going to be a lot of photos from here. Just a fair warning for those of you wanting to just go straight to the Coney Island part of the update.

I know it may not seem like it thanks to the amount of stupid jokes I've written as captions (I want this site to be fun and silly. Not serious and drab), but I genuinely enjoyed learning about all this and seeing all of the exhibits (as demonstrated by the sheer number of photos).

So I've had A LOT more Hot Dogs since my last visit <a href="TPRConeyIsland.html">here</a>. And since I had Pinks Hot Dogs just <a href="The2020Update.html">7 months ago</a>, it'd be a good oppertunity to compare the two and see which Hot Dog place is better.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="nathans6.JPG" width="640" height="480">

I'm sorry New Yorkers, but Pinks Hot Dogs is better #SorryNotSorry.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="nathans7.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Nathan's Hot Dogs definately seemed....crisper. They had more of a crunch, whereas Pinks seemed thicker. And maybe that's why others will claim Nathan's is better, which...fair enough. But regardless, both are super good hot dog places (And the original versions of both are superior to the clone stands of both),
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign884.JPG" width="640" height="480">

Unfortunately, there was no ass-bumping today. Sorry for the dissapointment.

All right. That's enough culture and food. We're IncredibleCOASTERS. Time for some theme park action.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="sign885.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
Yeah. While masks were optional at most parks, Coney Island was the one exception that had a mask requirement all throughout the park. Mildly annoying, but if it prevents the lockdown of 2020, I'll take it.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tickler4.JPG" width="640" height="480">

First coaster of the day, surprisingly, we're gonna go with Tickler.
</center>
	 
 <p>
<center>
<img src="tickler5.JPG" width="640" height="480">
</center>
<center>
So this ride is unique for being the only Spinning Mouse that spins throughout the entire ride. That makes it stand out among all the other clones.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="tickler6.JPG" width="640" height="480">

It may not spin the most, but it still is cool to have some spinning on the big drops.

Nope. This was the Mini Mouse that was at <a href="TPRBowcraftNYC.html">Victoria Gardens</a>. However, that place closed, and....I guess Coney Island decided to buy a new coaster on a discount. I personally don't care, but all you credit whores can rejoice at still being able to get the credit.

Even when this was my first Starflyer, I wasn't too impressed. But I still enjoyed it for the view of the ocean and NYC. But between riding so many more Starflyers, including the one with the stunning view of <a href="TPRTivoliGardens.html">Copenhagen</a> and the 400 ft one we rode earlier on this trip at SFNE, this one isn't worth our time at all.

While this is only going to be a....kiddy or family coaster (something about the size of one of those Big Roller Skaters I think), I'm sure it'll be a fun little ride.

Quick note. These have to be some of the WORST restraints ever. Even in a stationary position, they pinch me, and just feel....awkard, jenky, and uncomfortable. Zamperla REALLY needs to work on that.

And....yeah. All the horror stories are true. We finally have another contender for our <a href="Top10WorstCoasters.html">Top 10 Worst Coasters</a> List (BTW, we just updated it. I know A LOT of our lists are out of date. But this is the first one we've managed to update in a long time. Let alone the new ones we want to make, but don't have the time to do so. Oh, and we also have a review out of this <a href="ThunderboltCONEYISLANDPhotos.html">abomination</a>).

The first drop and loop are bad, but not unbearable. It rattles a lot, and the restraints are like that of a giant plastic crab pinching you in the thighs, but aside from that, it's tolerable.

However, when it comes to any part with laterals, it gets REALLY bad and practically treats you like a car crash dummy.

Now the interesting thing I keep hearing is that it's only Thunderbolt that's unbearable and that the clones of this are surprisingly decent. I'll see if that's true when I eventually get to the one in Alabama (I think it's safe to say I'll get to that clone before any of the other ones), but I'm not holding my breath for a clone of a peice of sh*t to not suck.

OK. So as you know, I'm one who'll defend the Volares and say they're not nearly as bad as people say they are. But....*Sigh* This ride did NOT age well within the 10 years since I last rode it. While still not as bad people say they are, it's safe to say that it rode far more like the Volare at <a href="TPRSarkanemmi.html">Sarkanemmi</a> is now about on par with your average SLC.

Despite the noticable decline in quality, I will still argue that Thunderbolt is FAR worse. #FightMe

Yeah, it's clunky and awkward, but those inline twists still have some fun hangtime. You say clunk, I say hangtime.

Please do some work on this, because it can be a lot better (I don't have high hopes for Time Warp @ Canada's Wonderland).

Hey guys. I think one of the horses from Steeplechase got loose. You might want to bring him back.

So one upside of Coney Island is that they allow you to get a single ride on the normally upcharge rides, such as the Booster and Slingshot. This is great as....they're really fun rides. But...yeah. You get reminded that the capacity is horrible.

 <p>
<center>
<img src="slingshotCONEYISLAND.JPG" width="480" height="640">

Getting on the slingshot, was a bit more of a challenge since....nobody else wanted to ride it, so I had to wait for another single rider. Eventually, I found a group of 3, and rode with them. Fun ride and makes me miss the days where I could ride this at SFMM for free back when Cody and I worked there. But the most intersting part was learning that they were from LA (this is one of the few out of state parks you can admit to being from CA without outing yourself as a coaster enthusiast since....famous landmark in NYC), and then after mentioning them planning on doing Thunderbolt next, convincing them to do Coney Island Cyclone instead as that's much better.

Unfortunately, Phoinex, the new for 2021 coaster for Coney Island (technically Deno's Wonder Wheel) is not ready for us, and won't open until about a week after the trip is over. So....*sigh* Came just a little bit to early for you.

<img src="phoenixCONEYISLAND2.JPG" width="640" height="480">

And I gotta admit. This thing looks pretty decent by family coaster standards. I have a feeling that this'll beat Orkanen as far as family inverted coasters go.

Next time I'm in New York City, I'll be riding you and seeing just how good you really are.

Well, despite the new for 2021 coaster not being ready, we still had a really fun time at Coney Island. Looking foreward to riding the new coasters on my next trip to New York City.

Unfortunately, this place was not that good. *Sigh* I mean, it wasn't bad. I mean, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ahcDlu-akk">there's no such thing as bad pizza</a>. However, this was NOT the NYC Pizza I rave about. I can think of several pizza places back home in SoCal with better pizza than this place. I've got a funny feeling that Scott's Pizza Tours doesn't stop here.
