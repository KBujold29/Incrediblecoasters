It wasn't as good as we expected it to be, but it was still fun and it barley made my Top 10 steel list.

The operations for Ghostrider SUCKED!!!! The ride operaters kept on constantly chatting, there were lots of line jumpers, It was an hour wait and right when we're about to get on, they add a second train which took an hour because the ride operaters were stalling!!!!!!!!

Screamin Swing is a fun ride. I just think it should be free like everything else at Knotts.
