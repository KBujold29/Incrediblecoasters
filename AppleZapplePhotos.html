We're here at Kings Dominion where we'll be reveiwing Apple Zapple, the parks Wild Mouse. Quick side note. This has to be one of the best names for any coaster. I know this is a name that I'm sure most people will roll their eyes at cause it's so stupid. But in all honesty, this thing is just so....cartoonish that I can't help but enjoy it. After getting in the seats and pulling down the lap bar, you go up the lifthill. Up, up, and up you go. The view isn't anything special, but you do get a decent view of Twisted Timbers. Wish we were on that right now. We reach the top of the lift hill. Turn to the left, and then we see it. The big drop. Yep, this is one of the Wild Mouse models that has the big drop at the beginning. Yeah, Its fun. WEE!!! And then we rise back up to the top. Yeah, that was fun. I wish other Wild Mice had this big first drop. We then hit a set of brakes, and now the Wild Mouse part is about to begin. And yeah. It's kind of slow during these turns. I mean, don't get me wrong, there are still laterals here, they're just not quite as strong as on the other Wild Mouse Coasters. The turns start to get faster and by the last set of turns, we're about on par with the other Wild Mice. After this, we then go through a big sweeping turn and then go through a small dip. Its not too amazing, but it is a fun little dip that makes us squeal with joy. We then hit some brakes, go around another turn and go through another dip. Yeah, you can sort of see a pattern within this type of ride. We then head into some brakes, these slow us down as we meander through a few more turns until we finally head straight into the final brake run. Yeah, its one of the Big Drop Wild Mouse models, which are always fun. They may not be the biggest or craziest coasters out there, or even the craziest Wild Mouse, but fit does make for a good family coaster, which is a welcome addition to Kings Dominion. Definetly make sure to give it a ride. You will have fun.
