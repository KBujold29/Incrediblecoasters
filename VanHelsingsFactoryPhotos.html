We're here at Movie Park Germany. Today's coaster is actually an indoor coaster, and one of the more intersting rides at Movie Park Germany. Van Helsing's Factory. A Gerslauter Bobsled that while it technically has a bad layout, it's a fun little ride. So let's get in the cars, pull down the lap bars, and away we go. It starts out well enough, with a dark ride section actually. It's hard for me to tell what's going on since not only do I not speak German, but I also have never seen Van Helsing. So I'm completely lost. I just know that they're in this subway with a bunch of guns and a shooter. We then climb up the lifthill, getting some really cool and special lighting effects. And then, we head down a spiral drop, and the actual ride begins. Now, it's all in the dark, so it's hard to really see what's going on during all of this. We then go through a bunch of lateals in the dark before eventually stopping at a midcourse brake run, themed to a bridge. But that doesn't really slow us down and the laterals continue. We get a couple more laterals, before another stop and another dark ride section. We see some cars, before dropping back down into the pit of madness. We then head into some laterals, flash by some strobe lights, and while it's all been fun before. This is the part of the ride that everyone talks about. The laterals at the end. They're strong. REALLY F*CKING STRONG!!! Now some people say that they're too strong and that it's painful, but honestly, it's my favorite part of the ride by far. It's the only part that really seems to be agressive and pack a mean punch. But sadly, just as it's getting strong, it's over. While far from a great ride, Van Helsing's Factory is a fun ride in the dark with some special effects. And if you like laterals, then you will love this ride.
