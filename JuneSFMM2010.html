So, today, we went off to SFMM. Now Cody was supposed to ride his bike all the way to SFMM, but he ended up getting a flat tire in Fillmore and had to get a ride the rest of the way there.

</center>
<center>
Yeah. These are the crowds I'd like to see all the time.

<center>
Scream was fun, but it made me miss Medusa.
</center>

</center>
<center>

<center>
That's weird. I guess Biohazards make your hair turn pink. 
</center>

<p>

</center>
<center>
It also turns B&M Inverts Blue. Batman is still suffering from it's contact with the Biohazard 6 months ago.

I certainly hope that Studio 6F doesn't get pushed back till 2011 like *cough*Mr. Six*cough*

Riddlers was running good. As usual.

</center>
<center>
Cody decided to go back to his old ways and soak himself on Tidal Wave's bridge. Not a smart idea.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="tidalwave17.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
But look at that!! He comes out completely dry.

  <img src="teddybear.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Not only does Goldrusher now have its gum lifthill back, but now it's got a teddy bear there as well!!!
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="goldrusher32.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
"Hey you with the camera! Have you seen my teddy bear?"
</center>

  <img src="ninja27.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Hmm. There's something different about Ninja.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninja28.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Oh yeah. Ninja is now sponsered by the Karate Kid.
</center>

<p>
<center>
  <img src="ninja29.JPG" width="640" height="480" />
</center>
<center>
Unlike Viper's old Hair Gel trains which made you want to claw your eyes out, these new Karate Kid wraps arn't half bad.
</center>

<p>

No matter what sort of downgrades Six Flags Magic Mountain does to their wooden coasters or how long they postpone simple projects, at least they've always got this awesome ride.

<center>
Oh, and during our day at SFMM, our parking receipt got sunburnt. Yes, our Parking Receipt got sunburnt. I've looked on the internet, and can't find anything about sunburt or tanned parking receipts. Strange. =/
